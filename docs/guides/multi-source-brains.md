# Multi-source brains

**A single gbrain database can hold multiple knowledge repos.** Each one
is a `source`: a logical brain-within-the-brain with its own slug
namespace, its own sync state, and its own federation policy. The rest
of this guide walks the three canonical scenarios.

(Sources are the *within-one-database* axis. If you want to connect a
whole separate database — a team-published brain with its own access
policy — that's the *brain* axis: `gbrain mounts add`. See
`docs/architecture/brains-and-sources.md` for the two-axis topology.)

## The three scenarios

### 1. Unified knowledge recall (wiki + gstack)

You have a personal wiki and a `gstack` checkout. Both belong to you,
both are knowledge you want your agent to recall across. When you ask
"what did I learn about X?" you want the best hit whether it lives in
the wiki or in a gstack plan.

```bash
# Register the gstack source, federate so it joins cross-source search
gbrain sources add gstack --path ~/.gstack --federated

# Pin the directory so `gbrain sync` knows which source it's walking
cd ~/.gstack && gbrain sources attach gstack

# Initial sync
gbrain sync --source gstack

# Now `gbrain search "retry budgets"` returns hits from BOTH wiki and
# gstack. Each result includes source_id so the agent can cite properly.
```

Result: wiki pages and gstack plans are separate (different source_ids,
different slug namespaces) but share the search surface.

### 2. Purpose-separated brains (news-desk + essays)

You run two completely different content pipelines on the same backend.
`news-desk` covers company news and founder profiles. `essays` is
personal writing. You explicitly DON'T want them mixed in search — news
content leaking into essay searches is a bug, not a feature.

```bash
# Two sources, both isolated (federated=false)
gbrain sources add news-desk --path ~/news-desk --no-federated
gbrain sources add essays --path ~/writing --no-federated

# Pin each checkout directory
(cd ~/news-desk && gbrain sources attach news-desk)
(cd ~/writing && gbrain sources attach essays)

# Sync each independently
gbrain sync --source news-desk
gbrain sync --source essays
```

Result: searching from neither directory returns the `default` source
(your main brain). Searching from inside `~/news-desk` returns only
news-desk hits. Searching from inside `~/writing` returns only essays.
Federation is opt-in, not leaked.

To search across every source explicitly on demand (trusted local CLI;
`--source` takes exactly one id):

```bash
gbrain search "tech layoffs" --source-id __all__
```

### 3. Mixed (wiki federated + sessions isolated)

Your main wiki is federated with a few trusted sources. Your session
transcripts (`gbrain transcripts` ingests them) land in a separate
isolated source so they don't dominate every search result.

```bash
# Federated sources
gbrain sources add gstack --path ~/.gstack --federated

# Isolated source for session transcripts
gbrain sources add sessions --path ~/.claude/sessions --no-federated
```

## Resolution priority

When any command needs to pick a source, gbrain walks this list (highest
first):

1. Explicit `--source <id>` flag.
2. `GBRAIN_SOURCE` environment variable.
3. `.gbrain-source` dotfile in CWD or any ancestor directory.
4. A registered source whose `local_path` contains the CWD (longest
   prefix wins for nested checkouts).
5. The brain-level default set via `gbrain sources default <id>`.
6. The seeded `default` source.

So inside `~/.gstack/plans/` on a brain that pinned `gstack` to
`~/.gstack` via `.gbrain-source`, `gbrain put` implicitly writes to
the `gstack` source. Outside any registered directory with no env/dotfile
set, it writes to the default.

## Federation flag

Every source row stores `config.federated: boolean` in its JSONB config.

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `true` | Source participates in unqualified `gbrain search "X"` results. |
| `false` (default for new sources) | Source only searched when explicitly named via `--source <id>` or qualified citation. |

The seeded `default` source is `federated=true` so single-source brains
behave as you'd expect — every page appears in search.

Flip later with `gbrain sources federate <id>` / `unfederate <id>`.

## Commands

The most-used subcommands (run `gbrain sources --help` for the full,
always-current reference — it also covers `status`, `current`,
`set-cr-mode`, and the `push`/`pull` durability surface):

```
gbrain sources add <id> --path <p> [--name <n>] [--federated|--no-federated] [--force]
                               Register a source. id: [a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]{0,30}[a-z0-9])?
                               --path must be a git repo (or a subdirectory of one) — see
                               "The git requirement for --path sources" below. --force
                               skips that check to register before git-init exists.
gbrain sources add <id> --url <git-url> [--pat-file <p>] [--clone-dir <path>] [--no-harden]
                               Clone + register a remote repo in one step; auto-hardens
                               for durability when a PAT is provided (see "Durability" below).
gbrain sources list [--json]   List all sources with page counts + federation state.
gbrain sources archive <id>    Soft-delete: hide from search, keep data for a TTL
                               grace window. Prefer this over `remove`.
gbrain sources restore <id>    Un-archive. `gbrain sources archived` lists expiries;
                               `gbrain sources purge` permanently deletes expired archives —
                               except sources still referenced by a registered OAuth client
                               (reported as `Blocked:`, sweep continues); revoke or rescope
                               the client (`gbrain auth revoke-client <id>`) and re-run.
gbrain sources remove <id> [--confirm-destructive] [--dry-run]
                               Permanently cascade-delete a source (pages, chunks,
                               timeline). Shows an impact preview first.
gbrain sources rename <id> <new-name>
                               Change display name only; id is immutable.
gbrain sources default <id>    Set the brain-level default.
gbrain sources attach <id>     Write .gbrain-source in CWD (like kubectl context).
gbrain sources detach          Remove .gbrain-source from CWD.
gbrain sources federate <id>
gbrain sources unfederate <id>
```

## The git requirement for --path sources

Every `--path` source must be a git repository (or live inside one — a
subdirectory of a git repo works too) with at least one committed, tracked
file under that path. `gbrain sources add` validates this at registration
time and refuses a directory that doesn't qualify — no `.git` at all, a
`git init` with no commit yet, or a commit made before `git add` — with an
actionable error instead of silently registering a source that will fail
(or worse, "succeed" while importing nothing) on its first `gbrain sync`.
Fix it with:

```bash
git -C <path> init
git -C <path> add -A
git -C <path> commit -m "initial import"
gbrain sources add <id> --path <path>
```

Two details that are easy to miss:

- **Files must actually be committed, not just present.** The sync walker
  reads files through git objects, so `git init` alone — even followed by an
  empty commit (`git commit --allow-empty`) — isn't enough. Registration
  checks for real tracked content (`git ls-tree HEAD` scoped to the path),
  not just a resolvable `HEAD`, so this footgun is caught immediately
  instead of surfacing later as a sync that imports nothing. For files that
  are deliberately untracked or `.gitignore`d but should still sync, use
  `gbrain sync --include-gitignored` — it forces a full filesystem walk so
  periodic syncs see ignored/untracked syncable content the git-object walk
  skips (`gbrain import <dir> --include-gitignored` is the one-shot import
  equivalent). Doctor's `multi_source_drift` advice names this case:
  a slug stuck at `default` whose file is untracked won't be recreated by a
  plain re-sync, so reach for the flag (or commit the file) before any
  delete step.
- **`--force` registers the source anyway**, skipping the check. Use this if
  you're registering a path before an automated pipeline gets around to
  `git init`-ing it. GBrain never auto-`git init`s a `--path` source for
  you — it's your directory, not a gbrain-managed clone (same consent
  boundary as sync-time self-heal, which also never mutates a `--path`
  source without an explicit ask).

**If sync ever reports a problem with the sync anchor** (`last_commit`) —
after a force-push, a history rewrite, or a from-scratch `git init` on a
directory that was synced before — you do not need to reset anything by
hand. `gbrain sync` detects an unreachable or non-ancestor anchor
automatically and recovers: either a full reimport (anchor object missing)
or a direct tree-to-tree diff against the orphaned bookmark (anchor present
but rewritten), advancing the anchor to the new HEAD when it completes.

## Sources in a Git subfolder

A `--path` source can point at a subfolder of a Git repository, for example
`gbrain sources add vault-notes --path ~/vault/notes` where `~/vault` holds
the `.git` directory. Such a source has two possible roots for its slugs and
stored file paths, called its **slug-root mode**:

| Mode | `~/vault/notes/people/alice-example.md` becomes | When it is chosen |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `source-root` | slug `people/alice-example`, stored path `people/alice-example.md` | The default for a new subfolder source: the same slugs a plain `gbrain import ~/vault/notes` would give. |
| `git-root` | slug `notes/people/alice-example`, stored path `notes/people/alice-example.md` | When you sync with `gbrain sync --repo ~/vault --src-subpath notes` (you named the Git root as the base), or when the source already has pages whose slugs carry the `notes/` prefix. |

The mode is decided once, by the first real sync or the first coordinated page
write (such as `put_page`) that records a new file path, and pinned in the
source's configuration. A few older write paths, such as saved brainstorm
ideas, follow an existing pin but do not set one. Every later sync,
write and reader obeys the pin, so an existing brain never has its slugs
renamed. `gbrain sync --dry-run` works out the mode without pinning it. A
source at the root of its repository, or outside Git, has only one root and no
mode to choose.

**Say to your agent:** *"Add my ~/vault/notes folder as its own source and
keep its slugs relative to that folder."*

**Write-through.** When a write creates a page in a subfolder source,
gbrain writes `<source path>/<slug>.md` and records the stored path in the
source's mode. In `source-root` mode the next sync of that file finds the
same page instead of creating a twin. In `git-root` mode the recorded path
adds the subfolder prefix that the unprefixed slug lacks, so the next sync
can refuse that file with a slug/origin mismatch; there, add new pages as
files in the checkout and sync them. Pages that already have a stored path
keep writing to that file.

**Older stored paths.** Before v0.60.5.0, write-through recorded
Git-root-style paths (`notes/people/alice-example.md`) for pages in
`source-root` sources, which made the next sync fail. Sync now accepts that
older form when the rest of the path names the same page, and rewrites it on
the next import. No command is needed.

**`ambiguous_source_path`.** If both readings of an old stored path exist as
files, for example `~/vault/notes/people/alice-example.md` and
`~/vault/notes/notes/people/alice-example.md`, sync refuses instead of
guessing. Rename or move one of the two files, commit, then run
`gbrain sync --source vault-notes --no-pull --retry-failed`. The other
refusal reasons are listed in [write refusal reasons](write-refusals.md).

## Citation format for agents

When agents receive multi-source results they MUST cite pages in
`[source-id:slug]` form. Example:

> You told me about the distillation protocol — see [wiki:topics/ai]
> and [gstack:plans/multi-repo] for where this came from.

The citation key is `sources.id` (immutable). Renaming a source via
`gbrain sources rename` changes the display name only; existing
citations keep working.

## Writing to a specific source

```bash
# Pass --source explicitly
gbrain put topics/ai ... --source wiki

# Or rely on the dotfile / env / CWD match
cd ~/.gstack && gbrain put plans/multi-repo ...
# → source auto-resolves to gstack
```

Reads span federated sources by default. Writes require a resolved
source (explicit, inferred, or default). The resolver never picks a
source silently when ambiguous — it errors with a clear fix.

Unscoped writes are also guarded against landing in the wrong place. On a
brain with at least one other source and more pages outside `default` than
in it, an unscoped
`gbrain sync` refuses (pass `--source <id>` to redirect it), `gbrain import`
warns, and MCP stdio prints a once-per-process advisory when a write actually
resolves to the default tier. `gbrain sync --dry-run` previews the run and
prints the same routing guidance instead of refusing;
`GBRAIN_ALLOW_DEFAULT_WRITE=1` is the escape hatch when `default` really is
the intended target. **Say to your agent:** *"Show me what a sync would do
without writing anything"* — your agent runs `gbrain sync --dry-run`.

## Durability: keep a brain repo in sync (auto-harden)

This hardening path applies to unmanaged worktrees. After activating managed
writers, Git effects belong to the persistence outbox; generated legacy push
helpers refuse to run rather than bypass that ownership boundary. See the
[concurrent-write guide](concurrent-writes.md).

A long-lived agent that writes to a knowledge-wiki git repo needs three
things to never lose work: pull before it edits, push every write, and not
go stale while it sits idle. `gbrain sources harden` installs all of that,
idempotently. The moment you add a brain repo with a token, it runs
automatically:

```bash
# Clone + register a GitHub repo, then auto-harden it for durability.
# Use a fine-grained PAT scoped to just this repo.
gbrain sources add wiki --url https://github.com/you/brain-wiki.git --pat-file ~/.secrets/wiki-pat
#   → clones, then installs: local auto-push hook, scripts/brain-commit-push.sh,
#     always-on durability rules in AGENTS.md/RESOLVER.md, a 30-min pull cron,
#     and a repo-scoped credential. Verifies push works before declaring done.

# Run the same audit on an existing source any time (idempotent):
gbrain sources harden wiki --pat-file ~/.secrets/wiki-pat

# Pull on demand (the cron calls the --path form, which never opens the DB):
gbrain sources pull wiki

# Remove the durability scaffolding (also runs automatically on `sources remove`):
gbrain sources unharden wiki
```

What hardening guarantees:

- **Pull-first, conflict-safe.** Every pull is a divergence-safe rebase. A
  dirty working tree is skipped (your in-progress edits are never touched); a
  rebase conflict is aborted cleanly and flagged for attention, never left
  half-applied.
- **Push is never deferred.** `scripts/brain-commit-push.sh "<msg>" <path>`
  commits and pushes, and refuses to report success without a successful push
  or confirmation that the exact destination branch at every effective origin
  push URL contains the attempted commit. A rejected push can still succeed when another process
  already pushed that commit; a stale local tracking ref is not confirmation.
  The post-commit hook is a best-effort background fallback; the helper is
  the guarantee.
- **No silent staleness.** A 30-minute background pull keeps an idle session
  current. It runs DB-free, so it never contends with a live brain for the
  PGLite single-writer lock.

Flags: `--no-cron` skips the scheduled pull, `--no-verify` skips the push
probe, `--dry-run` reports what would change, `--json` emits a machine
report, `--all` hardens every source with a remote (same-account only).
`--no-harden` on `sources add` opts out of auto-harden.

After upgrading GBrain, run `gbrain sources harden <source-id>` on each machine
with an already-hardened source to refresh its local hook and
`scripts/brain-commit-push.sh`. Upgrading the CLI alone does not update those
installed scripts. Existing repo-local credentials are reused; no new token
is required when that credential still works.

Security: the push automation is installed locally per machine (never
committed into the repo), the token is wired per-repo (an existing
credential helper is reused when present), and it never appears in the repo,
the remote URL, logs, or the JSON report. For a self-hosted git server
reachable only over a filesystem path, set `GBRAIN_GIT_ALLOW_FILE_TRANSPORT=1`
(default is HTTPS-only).

## Upgrading an existing brain

`gbrain upgrade` runs the needed schema migrations automatically. Your
existing pages all live under `source_id='default'`. Behavior is
unchanged until you add a second source.

To add one:

```bash
gbrain sources add gstack --path ~/.gstack --federated
cd ~/.gstack && gbrain sources attach gstack && gbrain sync
```

Two commands. The existing default source is untouched.
