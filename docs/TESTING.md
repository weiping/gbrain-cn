# Testing (gbrain repo)

`test/local-install-lifecycle.serial.test.ts` exercises isolated Bun-link install,
keyless memory write/read/search, process reopen and migration/post-upgrade with
service-command tripwires. `test/e2e/grandfather-projection-postgres.test.ts`
checks guarded metadata-only grandfathering, duplicate source slugs, preserved
valid text projections and refusal to seal previously unsealed rows on Postgres.
`test/reindex-markdown-persistence.slow.test.ts` retains the bounded 3,600-page
real-CLI reindex, SIGKILL and resume workload; the diagnostic benchmark launcher
is `scripts/bench-reindex-markdown.ts`.

## CI runner capacity

Repository-owned Linux validation jobs use ephemeral Ubicloud runners pinned to
Ubuntu 24.04. The Ubicloud Managed Runners GitHub App must have access to this
repository and active billing in its connected project; runner labels alone do
not grant access. No Ubicloud API token is passed to workflow jobs.

| Workload | Runner | Capacity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit, serial, E2E, browser, compatibility, read-performance and deployment-matrix tests | `ubicloud-standard-16-ubuntu-2404` | 16 vCPU, 64 GB RAM |
| Heavy test suite and persistence invariant/soak matrix | `ubicloud-standard-30-ubuntu-2404` | 30 vCPU, 120 GB RAM |
| Native ARM64 glibc and musl tests | `ubicloud-standard-16-arm-ubuntu-2404` | 16 vCPU, 48 GB RAM |
| Coverage reports and Semgrep | `ubicloud-standard-4-ubuntu-2404` | 4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM |
| Planning, status aggregation, dependency audit, gitleaks and actionlint | `ubicloud-standard-2-ubuntu-2404` | 2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM |

macOS and Windows matrices stay on GitHub-hosted runners. Release building and
publishing also stay unchanged. The pinned upstream OSV reusable workflow does
not expose a runner override, so its runner remains upstream-owned.

The migration does not change shards, test selection, commands, timeouts,
thresholds, artifact collection or required check identities. The security
matrix retains its existing OS labels and changes only the Linux execution
target. `test/scripts/ci-runner-routing.test.ts` pins capacity and platform
routing; `.github/actionlint.yaml` declares the exact custom runner labels.
Actual GitHub job records and completed checks establish runner availability;
local workflow tests do not. More CPU and memory do not guarantee proportional
speedups for serial tests or external-provider requests.

Shared-skill tests distinguish canonical publication, protocol delivery, installed
files and native harness use. `test/shared-skills-transports.test.ts` and
`test/e2e/shared-skills-transports.test.ts` use real HTTP authentication, OAuth
issuance and a new stdio process; they do not prove vendor-native activation.
`test/persistence-skill-bundles.serial.test.ts` and
`test/persistence-skill-crash.slow.test.ts` exercise typed file-set CAS and
independent-process publication/restoration kills on PGLite in the unit lane and
PostgreSQL through `test/e2e/persistence-skill-bundles-postgres.test.ts`.

Shared persistence suites use `test/helpers/test-backends.ts`: direct invocation
defaults to PGLite, and a safe `DATABASE_URL` opts into both engines. Their E2E
wrappers select PostgreSQL before registering tests, refusing a missing or unsafe
database instead of silently running only the local backend. Backend selection is
captured at registration so hooks retain it after the import environment restores.
Every backend's assertions remain in the shared suites; engine-specific cases run
in their owning lane.

Ordinary PostgreSQL `setupDB()` clears fixture data, operator configuration and
source sync identity while retaining `config.version` and the stored embedding
identity, avoiding historical migration
replay against an already-current schema. Migration-focused fixtures use
`setupDB({ replayMigrations: true })`; an absent ledger also runs the cold chain.
`test/e2e/fixture-reset-postgres.test.ts` checks both paths, cleanup and vector-shape
preservation, including the deliberate legacy-width restoration helper. That
helper aligns both the physical columns and stored embedding identity with the
legacy test configuration; ordinary resets preserve that identity.

The required `shared-skills-compatibility` CI job builds the pinned pre-feature
executable with `scripts/build-shared-skills-baseline.sh` and supplies
`GBRAIN_TEST_OLD_BINARY` to `test/persistence-skill-old-binary.slow.test.ts`.
An absent old executable is an explicit skip, never old-writer evidence.
`test/shared-skills-catalog-performance.test.ts` runs the reproducible
10/100/1,000-skill read benchmark when `GBRAIN_TEST_SHARED_SKILLS_BENCHMARK=1`;
its timings and database-call counts are recorded diagnostics, while identity
and catalog-size assertions are deterministic.
The shared-skills cases under `evals/harness-instructions/` test interpretation
separately from executed calls and native sessions.

`scripts/shared-skills/lifecycle.ts` measures real authenticated HTTP enrollment,
revision/asset reads, publication, missed-notification polling, acknowledgments,
queue/recovery bytes, and concurrent read latency at 10/100/1,000 skills. Run it on
a quiet machine with the protocol and fixture boundaries in its
[README](../scripts/shared-skills/README.md). Its additional body/asset latency
comparison is experimental; report each engine's measured result without
substituting it for the existing `scripts/persistence/performance.ts` memory-read
gate. The five pure accounting tests run normally; the small runtime smoke is
explicitly opt-in and never counts as a full performance pass.

### Canonical reconciliation

`test/persistence-reconcile-merge.test.ts` pins loss-preserving field choices.
`test/persistence-reconcile.test.ts` runs the guarded repair and replay contracts
on PGLite and, with an explicit safe `DATABASE_URL`, isolated PostgreSQL databases.
It covers stale preconditions, current/original grants, private facts, retained
backups, ordinary mutations after repair, and competing publications.
`test/reconcile-owner-journey.serial.test.ts` drives real CLI requests through
HTTP and stdio PGLite owners before and after activation, restarts the owner, and
independently reads the newly remembered private fact and provenance.

`test/reconcile-crash.slow.test.ts` and `test/e2e/reconcile-crash*.test.ts` kill real
processes at all eight publication boundaries with activation off/on. PostgreSQL
uses one file per activation state to stay within the unchanged per-file cap. Optional
`GBRAIN_TEST_RECONCILE_CRASH_MANIFEST_DIR` retains executed-case evidence.
`test/e2e/reconcile-pgbouncer.test.ts` requires the transaction-mode pooler when
`GBRAIN_CI_REQUIRE_PGBOUNCER=1` and proves repair followed by a new private memory
write. The durable-persistence workflow runs these contracts on both supported
Bun versions and uploads the crash manifests; local CI runs the slow and E2E lanes.

`test/docs-navigation.test.ts` checks local links and fragments in the primary
install/memory guides and all `docs/architecture/key-files/` references, requires
every subsystem to be linked from `KEY_FILES.md`, and guards against blanket
graph-write and preference-routing claims. The fixture suite
`test/scripts/check-key-files-current-state.test.ts` covers history markers,
cross-subsystem duplicate entries, and byte caps for the entry docs and references.

Search reliability has real-planner and transport regressions in
`test/e2e/vector-candidate-safety-postgres.test.ts`,
`test/e2e/search-query-contract-postgres.test.ts`,
`test/e2e/projection-statistics-postgres.test.ts`, and
`test/e2e/search-readiness-http.test.ts`. The statistics tests include owner,
restricted-reader and FORCE-RLS roles; the candidate tests distinguish natural
plans from forced-HNSW controls and prove server cancellation of exact fallback.
`test/e2e/projection-recovery-parity.test.ts` runs the shared Markdown/code
recovery, graph-edge preservation and migration-origin contracts against
PostgreSQL; their root suites cover PGLite in the unit lane. PGLite work caps never
count a Promise race as cancellation evidence.
The recovery parity entry also runs `symbol-resolver-projection-race.test.ts`:
paused resolver/rebuild ordering, atomic rollback, candidate revalidation, and
a real PostgreSQL lock-wait receipt before releasing the competing writer.

`test/pglite-in-memory-create-retry.serial.test.ts` injects create failures while
using real PGLite instances and a validated schema snapshot. It pins one cold
retry only before an in-memory database has opened, both failure diagnostics,
schema replay after snapshot fallback, post-open cleanup and close poisoning,
concurrent connect/disconnect ordering, exit-code preservation, and exclusion of
the persistent repair path. Run it in its own Bun process because it mocks the
PGLite module. Its recovery cases discriminate against the no-retry base; its
post-open cleanup cases discriminate against a retry that replaces a live database.

`test/e2e/serve-http-oauth.test.ts` additionally pins confidential POST/Basic revocation, public-client SDK fallthrough, malformed/mixed authentication rejection, cross-client isolation, unknown-token opacity, metadata auth methods, no-store responses, strict post-revoke `401`, and retryable backend `503` semantics. SDK-driven discovery and real owner-approved PKCE also pin read-only bootstrap, explicit writer requests, scope clamping, and DCR delegation refusal. `test/oauth-scope-hint.test.ts` exercises the actual SDK middleware over HTTP without requiring a database.

`test/put-page-persistence.test.ts` and `test/e2e/put-page-persistence-postgres.test.ts`
pin durable page acceptance and ordinary-error publication: native contention
returns an accepted pending receipt without changing the page, and replay of its
original UUID commits exactly once after release. Filesystem or required
source-path failure rolls back the database transaction. Embedding failure
preserves the canonical receipt; a delayed result superseded by another revision
cannot install vectors. The PGLite suite also covers scoped physical file paths,
unchanged-content no-ops, legacy hashes, deletion/recreation, and sanitized
diagnostics. Actual process-death boundaries belong to the crash suites below.

`test/subagent-required-writes.test.ts` and
`test/subagent-put-page-rejection.serial.test.ts` distinguish a persisted write
from prose-only completion, rejected imports, and historical rejected ledger
envelopes across the Anthropic, gateway, and oneshot lanes. Unchanged saves,
optional-write jobs, and saved pages with failed enrichment are positive controls.
`test/cycle/global-freshness-postcondition.serial.test.ts` exercises the registered
maintenance handler with failed phases, incomplete children, budget deferrals,
abort/lock loss, and successful warning-only controls.

### Coverage responsibilities before consolidation

Assign ownership to an **assertion and its execution boundary**, not to a test
filename or a shared helper. Record the contract, backend, runtime version,
OS/architecture/libc, source-versus-compiled artifact, transport/authentication,
process/storage/crash boundary, workload size and required cadence. Shared
scenario code across two engines is not duplicate engine coverage: PostgreSQL
JSONB, locking and pooler behavior are not established by a PGLite pass.

| Responsibility | Execution owner | What it does not establish |
|---|---|---|
| Keyless behavior, structural guards and shared contracts | Unit shards and `verify` in `test.yml`; process-isolated serial and dedicated slow lanes where required | Real PostgreSQL, native activation or compiled behavior |
| PostgreSQL behavior and engine parity | Named and diff-selected jobs in `e2e.yml`; the complete nightly runner corpus | Execution of key-gated or native-door assertions merely because their files were discovered |
| Durable publication and recovery under sustained load | `persistence-validation.yml` and `scripts/persistence/README.md` | Power-loss safety, production authentication or equivalence to two smaller databases |
| Native lock ABI and compiled-process exclusion | `native-locks.yml`, compiled smoke and release validation | All compiled CLI features or native-harness activation |
| Browser journeys | Required `admin-browser` job and `admin/e2e/*.pw.ts` | Vendor-native agent behavior |
| Native agent doors and heavier operational scenarios | Explicit jobs in `heavy-tests.yml` | A passing skipped door or generic protocol test is not native activation |
| Live-provider and optional recipe/eval behavior | Their explicitly configured opt-in commands/jobs | A missing key, early return or skipped assertion is not live-provider evidence |
| Line-coverage accounting | PR `prCorpus` and nightly `fullCorpus` reports | Subprocess coverage, all platforms or proof that every discovered case executed |

Before removing repeated work, identify the surviving owner for the same
contract **and every relevant boundary**, prove that owner actually executes,
and retain its cadence, failure gate and coverage artifacts. A shared fixture
can reduce maintenance while keeping both engine arms. Making one crash lane
authoritative or collecting LCOV in a named owner requires a separate ownership
change; nightly sharding alone makes neither change.

Name the profile when reporting “all tests.” The local fast loop, `test:full`,
`ci:local`, required PR checks and nightly `fullCorpus` are not interchangeable
supersets. Native matrices, sustained persistence validation, browser tests and
optional recipe/eval commands have separate responsibilities. A faster nightly
E2E schedule does not shorten a PR critical path dominated by persistence.
Report matched executed timings separately from dry-run partition estimates,
including setup, queueing and retries; never count skip-only output as coverage.

### Test command tiers

The sequential E2E runner gives each test file a fresh `HOME` and `GBRAIN_HOME`.
Configuration written by a CLI initialization or schema migration remains
available within that file, but cannot change a later file's selected schema or
harness state. Each file's home is removed after it exits, including failures;
the runner's exit trap also cleans up interrupted runs.

Test command tiers, each with a clear scope:

| Command | What it runs | Wallclock | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bun run test` | Parallel unit-test fast loop. Sharded fan-out via `scripts/run-unit-parallel.sh` (default 4 shards — CPU-detected, clamped to a max of 8; 4 limits local PGLite WASM-init contention; GitHub CI uses 10 unit shards), then a serial pass over `*.serial.test.ts`. Excludes `*.slow.test.ts` and `test/e2e/*`. No pre-checks, no typecheck. Builds/refreshes the PGLite schema snapshot BEFORE the shard fan-out and exports `GBRAIN_PGLITE_SNAPSHOT` so PGLite-booting files restore a baked schema instead of replaying every migration (~3.5x per booting file; see "PGLite schema snapshot" below). Opt out: `GBRAIN_NO_SNAPSHOT=1`. Memory-safe by default: total concurrency (shards × intra-shard width) is capped to available memory at `GBRAIN_TEST_MEM_PER_FILE_MB` (default 1536 — a PGLite WASM instance) per concurrent slot, shedding INTRA-SHARD width first and shards only after it (bun's `--max-concurrency` bounds only `test.concurrent` tests — 1 file in the corpus — so intra width is nearly free to shed, while every dropped shard removes a whole bun process of real fan-out; shedding shards first would collapse a 16GB box to a serial 1×4 run, measured 3.25× slower than 4×1 on the same machine). Two phantom-failure classes are automatically re-run serially (the rescue pass): failures carrying the WASM out-of-memory signature, and shards killed externally (SIGTERM/SIGKILL well before the shard timeout — sibling workspaces' process cleanup, memory jetsam). On machines without coreutils `timeout`, the fallback watchdog drops a `.watchdog` sentinel before TERMing a shard at the cap so the WEDGED/EXIT-HANG classifier stays reachable there (a bare rc=143 would otherwise read as a plain failure). Phantoms pass serially and the run goes green with an `oom_rescued` note; real failures fail again serially and stay red. Knobs: `GBRAIN_TEST_NO_MEM_ADAPT=1`, `GBRAIN_TEST_NO_OOM_FALLBACK=1`, `GBRAIN_TEST_MAX_CONCURRENCY` (intra-shard, default 4), `GBRAIN_TEST_SHARD_TIMEOUT` / `GBRAIN_TEST_SHARD_KILL_AFTER`, plus `--shards N` / `--max-concurrency N` / `--dry-run` script args. | a few minutes on a Mac dev box | Inner edit loop. Default. |
| `bun run verify` | CI's authoritative pre-test gate set, fanned out by `scripts/run-verify-parallel.sh` through a bounded worker pool (default `detect_cpus`; override `GBRAIN_VERIFY_MAX_PARALLEL`) with the heavy checks ordered first (typecheck, the two compile-embed checks, admin build, fuzz bundles, guard self-tests, the PGLite-booting chronicle eval check, whole-tree greps). The battery includes the deterministic `check:eval-chronicle` eval gate; `check:eval-canary` is deliberately NOT in the battery (its test-file twin `test/eval-canary.test.ts` spawns the identical runner in the unit matrix, and CI's verify job and matrix always run together — the package script stays for on-demand runs, so `verify`-only local callers should know the canary rides the unit lane instead). The `CHECKS` array in that script is the single source of truth — CI literally calls `bun run verify` in a dedicated job. | ~50s (pool-bounded; longest check dominates) | Before pushing; before `/ship`. |
| `bun run test:full` | `verify && bun run test && bun run test:slow && [smart e2e]`. Smart e2e runs only when `DATABASE_URL` is set and propagates its failure; otherwise it prints a skip notice to stderr. Use `ci:local` to provision the databases and require PgBouncer execution. | ~3-5min depending on slow + e2e | Pre-merge sanity, before opening a PR. |
| `bun run ci:local` | Independent host gitleaks scans, then frozen dependencies, guards/typecheck, the complete serial and slow lanes, and four unit/E2E shards inside Docker. Each E2E shard has its own pgvector database; selected PgBouncer tests must execute against the transaction-mode pooler. Unit, serial, and slow lanes have database URL overrides unset. Any failed stage fails the command. Complete shard logs survive container teardown under `.context/ci-local-shards/`. `ci:local:diff` narrows E2E selection; `--no-shard` runs unit/E2E sequentially. Doc-only diffs still require successful gitleaks scans. | Depends on the full corpus | Full local gate before shipping. |
| `bun run test:slow` | Just the `*.slow.test.ts` set (intentional cold-path correctness checks). | seconds-to-minutes | When touching slow-path code. |
| `bun run test:serial` | Just the `*.serial.test.ts` set (cross-file-contention quarantine; one bun process per file for true module-registry isolation), run through a POOL of concurrent per-file processes — the isolation is per-process, not per-machine. Dispatch is heaviest-first (LPT) from the advisory `scripts/serial-weights.json` (seconds; mined from the `.context/serial-durations.txt` table each run banks; absent/corrupt weights fall back to discovery order, absent keys to the corpus p75 — scheduling only, never correctness; LPT order + the corrupt-weights fail-soft are pinned by `test/scripts/run-serial-pool.test.ts`). Pool defaults to `min(detect_cpus, 4)` then memory-adapts (same doctrine as the parallel runner); a small growth-guarded set of files (machine-global state or contention-critical timing — see the justified `EXCLUSIVE_FILES` list in `scripts/run-serial-tests.sh`, capped at 3 by `test/scripts/serial-files.test.ts`) runs on a sequential EXCLUSIVE lane after the pool. Per-test timeout 120s (pooled contention headroom); each pooled file is wall-clock-killed at 300s (`timeout -k`, exit-hang containment). `SHARD=N/M` partitions pooled files by duration; the three exclusive files run only on shard 1. Unset runs the complete corpus. Routing variables are cleared before tests start, so nested runners remain independent. Externally-killed files (exit 143/137 or a missing exit sentinel — sibling-workspace cleanup, memory jetsam) get ONE sequential rescue re-run, mirroring the parallel runner's doctrine: phantoms stay green with a rescue note, real failures stay red. Prints per-file PASS lines plus a top-10 slowest-files list. Knobs: `GBRAIN_SERIAL_POOL=N` (explicit pool width — bypasses the memory clamp; `1` restores fully-sequential), `GBRAIN_SERIAL_FILE_TIMEOUT`. | a few minutes for all ~220 files at pool=4 | Debugging quarantined files; CI's serial-tests job. |
| `bun run test:e2e` | Real Postgres E2E. Requires Docker + `DATABASE_URL`. Sequential within a shard; `SHARD=N/M` fans out against separate databases (ci-local runs 4 containers). Activates the PGLite snapshot like every other runner (per-file cold-path opt-outs where the test asserts the path TO post-initSchema state), exporting it as an ABSOLUTE path so CLI children spawned with varying cwd still find it. | ~5-10min | Pre-ship; nightly. |
| `bun run test:compile-smoke` | Self-update integrity verify under a REAL `bun build --compile` binary, offline (sets `GBRAIN_SELFUPDATE_COMPILE_SMOKE=1`). The unit suite mocks the network seams; this proves the dependency-free crypto/base64/JSON verify path survives compilation — the failure mode `sigstore-js` would have hit. | ~5s (one compile) | When touching `src/core/binary-self-update.ts`; pre-ship on self-update changes. |
| `bun run test:admin` | Pinned Playwright Chromium tests for the production embedded admin UI, served with an isolated temporary home/cwd and in-memory PGLite. Exercises owner login, OAuth consent, registration, setup, and lifecycle actions. | seconds-to-minutes | When touching the admin browser flow; required `admin-browser` CI job. |

For the admin browser lane, install frozen dependencies in the repository and
`admin/`, run `bunx playwright install --with-deps chromium` on Linux, then run
`bun run build:admin` before `bun run test:admin`. Tests live in
`admin/e2e/*.pw.ts` so Bun's unit-test discovery does not execute them. The
browser suite proves the GBrain dashboard journey; it does not establish
activation inside a native vendor harness.

There is no `check:all` script: a second, hand-synced guard registry would
drift from `verify`, leaving checks that never run anywhere. The `CHECKS`
array in `scripts/run-verify-parallel.sh` is the single execution list
(including `check:newlines`, `check:exports-count`,
`check:no-legacy-getconnection`). The guard REGISTRY is `scripts/guards-manifest.tsv` (see "Guard registry and
self-test" below).

`bun run typecheck` uses TypeScript's native incremental analysis in
`node_modules/.cache/gbrain-typecheck.tsbuildinfo`. Every invocation still runs
the compiler; source, root-file, configuration and dependency changes invalidate
the affected analysis, and cached diagnostics remain failures. The cache is local
and ignored by Git; CI does not restore prior typecheck results.

The local Docker runner isolates root and admin `node_modules`, plus the generated
admin bundle, in named volumes. Admin build dependencies, Vite's generated cache
and build output stay inside container volumes instead of replacing host files
or leaving root-owned directories behind. `ci:local --clean` removes these volumes
too; build the admin app on the host when updating its committed bundle.

### Native writer locks

`bun test test/native-lock.test.ts test/scripts/native-lock-prebuilds.test.ts`
checks real process exclusion, crash handoff, retained files, cancellation,
missing-addon failure and source/binary manifest integrity. Tests use isolated
temporary paths and never open an operator datastore. The required
`native-locks.yml` lane rebuilds and executes all eight OS/architecture/libc
targets on Bun 1.3.11, 1.3.13 and 1.4.2, including native musl Docker userspace.
Every pair also runs `bun scripts/native/compiled-smoke.ts` to prove compiled
process locking. Release CI verifies the shipped CLI embeds the matching
addon and runs the compiled smoke on its two release platforms. Rebuild
instructions and the precise packaging/runtime distinction are in
`native/locks/README.md`.
Release compilation uses Bun 1.4.2; strict Darwin codesign verification must
pass before publication. The native macOS 26.2 smoke is not macOS 27
certification, and Linux fault injection is not a full native Windows backup
create/restore test.

The glibc Linux, macOS and Windows matrix also runs
`persistence-publication-native.serial.test.ts`,
`persistence-git-publication.test.ts`,
`persistence-sync-origin-native.serial.test.ts` and
`backup-portability-native.serial.test.ts` in separate Bun processes. These
exercise real Git publication, historical source origins and backup restoration
with fresh-process reopen. macOS and Windows set
`GBRAIN_TEST_REQUIRE_CASE_INSENSITIVE=1`; a case-sensitive fixture must fail
rather than silently skip the publication regression. Inspect executed test
counts before claiming native coverage; a configured lane alone is not evidence.

The publication, sync-origin, processing-option and company-sync suites also
run separately with an explicit PostgreSQL URL in the persistence deployment
matrix. `test/e2e/persistence-publication-parity.test.ts` and
`test/e2e/persistence-sync-{origin,options,company}-parity.test.ts` include them
in the full local E2E gate; the keyless serial runner alone cannot exercise
their PostgreSQL branches.

The OpenClaw 2026.9.4 / Node 24.18.0 native-host fixture proves plugin startup,
restarted-turn saved-page pointer retrieval and same-slug source isolation with
a deterministic loopback provider:

```bash
GBRAIN_TEST_OPENCLAW_BIN=<absolute-installed-cli> \
GBRAIN_TEST_OPENCLAW_DATABASE_URL=<isolated-postgres-test-db> \
bun test test/openclaw-context-engine-native.serial.test.ts
```

The database user needs `CREATEDB`; fixtures create/drop unique databases
rather than truncating shared rows. Real-provider recall and macOS 27 behavior
remain unverified.

Focused safety coverage: `test/apply-migrations-safety.serial.test.ts` checks
force dry-run previews before DB/ledger access and failed-phase partial exit;
`test/real-home-guard-preload.test.ts` pins the test-home fingerprint backstop
(detection, not prevention). Managed retry, durable diagnostics, restart and
PGLite/Postgres parity are covered by `test/persistence-sync-failures.serial.test.ts`
and `test/e2e/managed-sync-failures.test.ts`. Backup remote readback and fsync
fault cases run in `test/backup-verification.serial.test.ts` and
`test/backup-fsync.serial.test.ts`; `test/e2e/backup-coverage-parity.test.ts`
covers PGLite/Postgres page/fact/config parity. Output redaction uses
`test/search/output-redaction.serial.test.ts` and
`test/search/output-redaction.test.ts`, including unchanged internal capture.

Managed writer fixtures use isolated PGLite and guarded disposable Postgres:
`test/e2e/fact-vector-repair-parity.test.ts`,
`test/e2e/fact-embedding-backfill-parity.test.ts`, and
`test/e2e/fact-backfill-resident.test.ts` cover preserved vectors, bounded
NULL-only fact backfill, selected-config refusal and owner-held PGLite IPC;
`test/ai/google-embed-batch-items.test.ts` pins 100-item provider batches.
`test/persistence-embedding-effects.test.ts`,
`test/persistence-effect-retry.test.ts`, and
`test/embedding-completion-atomic.serial.test.ts` cover partial vector
completion, exhausted durable attempts and state-bound explicit retry.
`test/managed-extract-atoms.test.ts`, `test/managed-facts-backstop.test.ts`
and their `test/e2e/` counterparts exercise admitted atom/fact replay,
including fresh-process facts authority. `test/persistence-connectors.test.ts`
covers managed bound/unbound Google/GitHub sources, API pagination and
source-scoped deletions. `test/persistence-connector-retry.test.ts` covers
explicit retry, compaction, checkpoint dependency identity, concurrent approval
and lost acknowledgements. Each suite creates its own home, engines and
lifecycle through `test/helpers/connector-fixture.ts`; the helper shares no
live engine or mutable suite state. Their separate E2E entry points,
`test/e2e/managed-connector-routing.test.ts` and
`test/e2e/managed-connector-retry.test.ts`, retain the runner's default
180-second per-file cap without duplicating the base cases in the retry lane.
Linux root runners execute the complete EACCES case in an isolated `setpriv`
child and assert UID 65534 before testing permissions. This needs a readable
checkout, not changes to the parent process identity or checkout permissions;
the CI runner image supplies `setpriv`.
`test/managed-maintenance.test.ts` and
`test/helpers/maintenance-restart.ts` cover local synthesize/patterns/
consolidation, restart replay, retired takes and semantic snapshots;
`test/managed-unsupported-preflight.serial.test.ts` checks unsupported bulk
lanes refuse before spend. These use synthetic provider/API transports, not
paid model calls or production connectors. PGLite dream/job CLI with an active
owner is **not** proven delegated by the live fact-backfill IPC test.

`test/facts-worker-config.test.ts` and its PostgreSQL E2E counterpart dispose
the original consumer before executing a real facts-absorb job. They verify the
worker passes trusted selected configuration, ignores job-supplied configuration
and settles the entity-page effect with zero fact or chunk embedding calls when
disabled. Fact extraction still captures the generated fact with a NULL embedding.

`test/managed-facts-embedding.test.ts` and its PostgreSQL counterpart bind retained
fact vectors to the selected brain's model and dimensions, including equal-width
host/mount mismatches, keyless capture, policy changes and replay without new spend.
`test/managed-atom-regressions.test.ts` and its PostgreSQL counterpart preserve
later target edits through explicit retries and honor database-only storage policy
without relaxing source authority. `test/managed-synthesis-postprocess.test.ts`
and its E2E wrapper verify that completed quote/provenance work never rewrites a
later user edit, while unfinished work resumes against its original revision.
The synthesis suite also preserves the existing same-date summary on replay and
rebuilds a complete index after partial recovery. `test/managed-atom-compaction.test.ts`
and its PostgreSQL counterpart age and compact real receipts: permanent completion
identity still prevents repeated extraction, while expired retry payloads produce
an explicit refusal without changing terminal outcomes or compaction accounting.
`test/managed-facts-compaction.test.ts` and its PostgreSQL counterpart cover the
same lifetime boundary for explicit and derived fact-batch identities, including
failed or partially committed batches and successful replay without new spend.
Connector sweep fencing and physical-path normalization have separate parity
coverage in `test/persistence-connector-fencing.test.ts`. Standalone crash/recovery
cases live in `test/persistence-connector-recovery.test.ts` and their own E2E
wrapper so they do not share the routing file's wall-clock budget; their original
assertions, child watchdogs and per-file timeout are unchanged.

`test/managed-atoms-cli.slow.test.ts` exercises real disk-backed PGLite CLI
recovery with a loopback provider: live-owner refusal, graceful owner stop,
malformed extraction, explicit same-input retry, idempotent replay and owner
restart. Fresh-process readback checks the private canonical file, searchable
chunk, retained failure receipt, committed completion and released leases.
`test/managed-connector-routing.serial.test.ts` pins actual activation and
`performSync` routing for API sources; the maintenance suite also drives
`runCycle` with eligible facts in two sources and proves the other source is
unchanged. The E2E wrapper files ensure these optional PostgreSQL arms execute
in the database lane rather than only passing their PGLite controls.

For platform-only feedback, dispatch
`gh workflow run test.yml --ref <branch> -f native_only=true`. This explicit manual option uses a separate concurrency
group so it does not cancel an ongoing full persistence soak. Its
`native-only-validation-scope` artifact records the exact commit and
`full_ci: false`; it never emits the required `test-status` check for unrun full
CI. Omitting the option preserves every normal PR, push and full manual gate.

### Datastore shutdown and lease ownership

`test/pglite-lock.test.ts` proves process pause/crash handoff, metadata damage,
legacy migration refusal and stable ownership across datastore replacement.
`test/pglite-engine-disconnect.serial.test.ts` uses actual disk-backed PGLite
for concurrent opens, consumer/statement drains, persisted reopen, delayed
close and failed close. A close deadline retains the kernel lock; it is never
successful shutdown evidence. Watchdog and telemetry regression suites cover
loop starvation and background statement teardown.

`test/db-lock-concurrency.test.ts` proves unique identities even when two
acquisitions have identical database timestamps, exact successor-safe cleanup,
renewal cancellation/late-completion drain and mandatory loss propagation.
`test/e2e/db-lock-acquisition-token.test.ts` repeats acquisition/cleanup
invariants against real Postgres; the E2E map selects it for lease and engine
changes. `test/engine-control-routing.test.ts` pins direct/shared pool routing,
nested transaction confinement and the Postgres resident-stop barrier.

### Durable persistence schedules and process crashes

`test/persistence-consumer-scheduling.test.ts` pins completion wake-ups,
including a wake-up arriving during an active tick, without lowering the idle
poll interval. Per-root deadlines preserve blocked/retryable backoff even while
another root keeps committing; expired deadlines permit retries. Shutdown drains
active preparation without starting another request.
`test/persistence-root-refresh.test.ts` checks that unchanged root registrations
do not replace their durable files while unbound, moved and original bound paths
all remain fenced.

`test/e2e/persistence-http-liveness.test.ts` drives real authenticated HTTP MCP
with legacy and source-bound OAuth credentials against an isolated PostgreSQL
database. It covers pending page/fact writes, lost acknowledgments, owner
interruption, exact canonical readback, 44 pages over three clients, and current
receipt authorization. Set `GBRAIN_TEST_OLD_BINARY` to a retained compatible
executable to additionally exercise old/new owner handoffs in both directions
for queued, actually claimed and recovery-bearing rows. Interrupted owners are
reaped and native exclusion is verified before their successors start; only the
abandoned running lease is advanced by the fixture. An omitted executable skips
these compatibility cases, not proves them.
`test/e2e/persistence-phase-liveness.test.ts` holds real table/row locks and
ordinary/direct pool slots to verify phase cancellation (including capacity
marking), tracked queued `BEGIN`, renewal, expired-head FIFO and shutdown fences.
A loopback TCP gate separately delays or rejects cold direct initialization,
checking retained work through shutdown and same-ID completion after retry.
The memory-mutation tests use a
deterministic loopback embedding transport for slow and aborted preparation;
they do not contact a paid provider. Receipt contract, MCP parser, IPC and CLI
tests pin the same nested allowlist and advisory age policy. Diagnostic tests
exercise both fresh/index-upgrade parity and a genuinely interrupted PostgreSQL
concurrent index build when a PostgreSQL fixture is supplied.

`test/persistence-chaos.slow.test.ts` and `test/e2e/persistence-chaos.test.ts`
execute real journal/coordinator schedules and eight SIGKILL publication
boundaries, followed by a small multi-process soak. The Postgres test creates
and drops fresh test databases, requiring CREATEDB on the explicit test URL.
It never truncates the shared E2E database. The reusable
`persistence-validation.yml` gate runs 1,000 schedules and 10,000 writes per
engine under Bun 1.3.11 and 1.3.13 and uploads actual executed-case manifests.
See [`scripts/persistence/README.md`](../scripts/persistence/README.md) for
workloads, reruns, performance measurements and the process-crash scope.

`test/e2e/persistence-runtime-matrix.test.ts` additionally requires the real
transaction-mode PgBouncer fixture. Its 24 cells exercise direct/pooler
connections, enforced RLS under a non-bypass role, ordinary pool sizes 1/2/3,
and shared pools or a separate one-connection direct route. It verifies
reserved short control capacity while bulk connections remain held, then
drains and commits the original request. Ownership cases cover mismatched
successor manifests, stale owners, root replacement under a held kernel
lock, and actual source deletion/recreation. The reusable persistence lane
runs this matrix on both supported Bun versions and uploads its manifest.

The required persistence lane also runs `scripts/persistence/performance.ts`
on both engines and Bun versions. Three independent instances use the
existing 500-page/200-query read-latency corpus, with public `put_page`
mutations and actual in-flight interval coverage of at least 90%. Any read
or write failure invalidates the sample. CI uses `--informational`: the 50%
loaded-versus-idle p99 threshold is advisory, not a merge blocker. Loaded
reads compete with additional write work, so this ratio alone is not evidence
of a change regressing the same workload. Manifests retain the original
threshold verdict, each sample, admission/commit latency, queue age, RSS,
recovery bytes and pool activity.
The CLI without `--informational` still enforces the threshold. The original
heavy shell entry invokes this harness; its optional `STRICT_LATENCY=1`
flag affects only the latency threshold, never validity requirements.

### PGLite schema snapshot (default-on)

`scripts/build-pglite-snapshot.ts` (`bun run build:pglite-snapshot`) bakes a
post-`initSchema()` PGLite data dir into `test/fixtures/pglite-snapshot.tar`
plus a version file; `PGLiteEngine.initSchema()` restores the tar instead of
replaying the embedded schema + all migrations when the env var
`GBRAIN_PGLITE_SNAPSHOT` points at it. Runners activate it through the shared
`ensure_pglite_snapshot` helper in `scripts/lib/test-env.sh` (also home of
`detect_cpus` and `detect_available_mem_mb`), sourced by
`run-unit-parallel.sh`, `test-shard.sh`, `run-slow-tests.sh`,
`run-serial-tests.sh`, `run-verify-parallel.sh`, and `run-e2e.sh` (which
re-exports the path as ABSOLUTE — its tests spawn CLI children with varying
cwd); `scripts/ci-local.sh` calls the builder directly. The helper builds/refreshes the snapshot and
exports the env var, no-ops on `GBRAIN_NO_SNAPSHOT=1` or an already-inherited
path, and is non-fatal on build failure — tests fall back to cold init, with
a one-line "active" echo so a silent fallback stays visible in CI logs.
Measured effect: ~3.5x per PGLite-booting file (a cold boot replays every
migration, ~3.1s each on a CI shard). Properties:

- **Idempotent.** A hash short-circuit exits in ~40ms when the snapshot is
  fresh, and REBUILDS a stale one. The hash covers the raw file bytes of
  `migrate.ts`, `pglite-schema.ts`, and their schema/migration helpers,
  including grant constraints and withdrawal triggers. Imported SQL and
  handler changes invalidate the fixture; coverage instrumentation does not
  change the hash. Keep the dependency list in `computeSnapshotSchemaHash`
  and the CI cache keys aligned when adding another schema helper.
- **Concurrency-safe.** Each profile has its own lock with a PID/token owner
  and host/process-namespace identity. Only a confirmed dead local owner using
  the current retirement protocol can be reclaimed. Both normal release and
  crash recovery retain a nonempty owner tombstone so a delayed observer cannot
  remove the next builder's lock. Keep those records while builders may run.
  Live, foreign, ownerless, or older-protocol locks time out without building;
  callers visibly fall back to cold initialization.
  Temporary tar/version files are atomically renamed, with the version last.

- **Never authoritative.** The loader (`tryLoadSnapshot` in
  `src/core/pglite-engine.ts`) verifies the schema hash AND the embedding
  shape the snapshot was baked with (`dims=` / `model=` lines in the version
  file) against what this process would create; any mismatch — including a
  version file without shape lines — warns once and falls through to normal
  cold init. A wrong fixture can never poison the suite.
- **Opt out.** `GBRAIN_NO_SNAPSHOT=1` skips the build + env export for a run;
  the migration-replay canary tests clear the env themselves regardless.

Pinned by `test/snapshot-shape-guard.test.ts` (hash + shape refusal matrix,
imported SQL/handler dependency hash sensitivity).

The builder accepts `--profile legacy|default` (legacy remains the default).
Legacy uses the unit preload's embedding shape. Default uses the CLI's canonical
embedding shape and writes `pglite-snapshot-default.tar` plus its `.version`.
The artifacts, locks, and CI caches are separate. `ensure_default_pglite_snapshot`
exports an absolute `GBRAIN_TEST_DEFAULT_SNAPSHOT`; BrainBench applies it only
to CLI children, including `run-all`. The parent unit process retains its legacy
snapshot. The slow runner and direct BrainBench test invocation prepare the
default profile automatically. `GBRAIN_NO_SNAPSHOT=1` clears both paths and
survives test preloads.

### Keeping CI partitions balanced

Required CI runs ten weighted unit workers, four serial workers with bounded
per-file pools, and up to four selected E2E workers. E2E selection and exclusions
run once before setup; the resulting file lists are frozen and executed against
separate Postgres services. An explicit empty selection launches no tests;
selection errors, failed workers, cancellations, and unexpected skips fail the
existing aggregate checks. Nightly full-corpus E2E uses four independent
Postgres jobs with the same weighted partitioner and one fresh Bun process per
file, sequential within each job. It does not use the selected-E2E exclusion
list: default discovery includes every `test/e2e/*.test.ts` and
`test/phantom-redirect-engine-parity.test.ts`.
Each full-profile worker first initializes its own service schema with the
guarded `setupLegacyEmbeddingDB()` helper, in a temporary home with provider
keys stripped and local environment-file loading disabled. No partition relies
on a preceding file to create shared tables. Bootstrap is a separate timed CI
step and must be included in end-to-end comparisons.

Refresh after a large test wave or when the longest shard repeatedly exceeds
the mean shard execution time by 25%:

```bash
bun run weights:mine --lane unit --run <successful-test-run>
bun run weights:mine --lane serial --run <successful-test-run>
bun run weights:mine --lane e2e --run <successful-e2e-run>
bun run weights:mine --lane e2e --e2e-profile full --run <successful-full-corpus-run>
```

The miner accepts `--from-file` or stdin for timestamped GitHub-format logs and
`--out` for inspection before replacing a checked-in map. Unit timing uses only
unit matrix jobs, includes `evals/`, and closes the final file at the Bun summary.
Serial timing uses runner durations, never timestamps of buffered output. E2E
uses each file's Bun summary and merges partial selections into known weights.
File/stdin imports also merge unobserved entries; only a complete GitHub unit,
serial or explicit full-profile E2E run replaces that lane's entire map. Captured artifacts need their final
successful completion marker, and GitHub imports verify every expected job.
Incomplete or failed inputs leave the existing map intact. Sidecar metadata
records the source run/commit, units, and counts. Unit/E2E weights are milliseconds;
serial weights remain seconds. New files receive the corpus p75 estimate. Empty
maps and zero-cost ties distribute files deterministically; corrupt serial
weights warn and retain safe fallback scheduling.

The default E2E miner reads selected jobs and merges partial observations.
`--e2e-profile full` instead requires a successful GitHub run with a source SHA
matching checkout HEAD. It pins the run attempt and full-job IDs, reconstructs
default discovery using the committed runner and tracked test paths, and
requires every source file exactly once across complete successful job logs.
Missing/extra files, ambiguous basenames, duplicate execution or failed evidence
leave weights and metadata untouched. Basename resolution preserves the
outside-directory parity entry. Full mode replaces the complete map and records
source SHA, attempt, jobs, log hash and corpus hash; file/stdin imports cannot
claim full-profile provenance. These weights schedule work; they are not an
observed parallel runtime.

CI retains timestamped unit/E2E logs, frozen E2E selection, and serial attempt
records for 14 days. Compare push-to-required-green time including queueing,
first failure, rescues/reruns, runner minutes, unique file counts, and coverage
completeness. Compare cold and warm caches separately. Snapshot timings and
partition estimates are projections until matched workflow runs confirm them;
successful test results are never cached.

### Guard registry and self-test

The privacy and test-isolation guards use `scripts/lib/guard-candidates.sh` to
scan fresh file contents in bounded batches before applying their detailed
per-file rules. They do not cache passing results. Candidate scanner failures
fail the guard, and matching files retain the same allowlists and diagnostics.

`scripts/guards-manifest.tsv` is THE single registry of `scripts/check-*`
guards (currently 48), each classified `scanner` (greps/parses repo sources —
must eventually carry fixtures), `buildfresh`, or `repostate` (build/freshness
guards are exempt-with-reason, not fixture-tested).
`scripts/guard-self-test.sh` (`bun run check:guard-self-test`, wired into
`bun run verify`) proves every `selftest=yes` scanner CAN fail: it runs each
one against known-bad (must exit non-zero) and known-good (must pass) fixture
trees under `test/fixtures/guards/<guard>/{bad,good}/` via the
`GBRAIN_GUARD_ROOT` env seam, and enforces manifest completeness — a new
`scripts/check-*` script that isn't registered in the manifest fails the
build. A guard whose pattern rots into a permanently-green no-op fails CI
instead of masquerading as coverage.

### Registry-walking ratchets

Structural suites that walk a registry so the NEXT gap of a known class
cannot ship silently. All allowlists below are shrink-only.

- `test/operations-coverage-ledger.test.ts` — every op in
  `src/core/operations.ts` maps to a covering test file in a checked-in
  ledger; the `UNCOVERED` allowlist only shrinks. Shares one
  registry-enumeration helper (`test/helpers/ops-registry.ts`) with the
  jobs-ops token-redaction sweep so two walkers can't drift.
- `test/operations-source-isolation-matrix.test.ts` — every non-localOnly
  read op runs under a scoped remote ctx and a federated grant; nothing
  carrying the other source's identity may return. Deliberate brain-wide
  behavior requires an explicit `BRAIN_WIDE_READS` entry with a rationale
  string. Anti-vacuity is mandatory: each op's control call must SEE the
  cross-source marker before its scoped assertions count; an op that can't
  be driven is an explicit counted SKIP disposition, never a silent pass.
- `test/scripts/e2e-wiring.test.ts` — every `test/e2e/*.test.ts` must be
  claimed by a PR-time lane (a `scripts/e2e-test-map.ts` row, a workflow
  mention, or the shrink-only `test/fixtures/e2e-unmapped-baseline.txt`),
  and every map entry must point at a real file (typo guard).
- `test/engine-surface-coverage.test.ts` — two-way census of the
  `BrainEngine` interface against the PGLite prototype (new methods force a
  visible list edit) plus a runtime `UNCALLED` ratchet scanning the whole
  test corpus for references, so a never-called engine method can't ship.
- `scripts/check-orphan-modules.mjs` (verify battery, guard-manifest
  registered with bad/good fixtures) — transitive import walk from the
  cli/mcp/engine entrypoints; a src module reachable from no entrypoint
  fails unless in the 4-entry reasoned allowlist, and the
  test-only-reachable tier has a shrink-only ceiling.

The takes-bootstrap graduation instrument (`evals/takes-bootstrap/`: 123-case
corpus, scorer, live harness + $0 replay) is CI-guarded keyless by
`test/eval-takes-bootstrap.test.ts` — the guard proves the instrument, not
the score; the autopilot tier flips only on a committed GRADUATED live run.

### Shell dispatch and Windows

All four of `test`, `verify`, `ci:local` and `test:e2e` hand off to shell scripts
under `scripts/`, so every `check:*` entry in `package.json` invokes its script as
`bash scripts/<name>.sh` instead of relying on the shebang — bun on Windows cannot
exec a `.sh` directly. Add a new shell-script check with that same prefix. The
`scripts/*.ts` entries run under bun and take no prefix.

The scripts must also be on disk with Unix line endings. A strict bash (WSL, Linux
CI, macOS) rejects CRLF and dies on the script's first meaningful line; the Cygwin
bash that ships with Git for Windows tolerates it, so a green local run is not by
itself evidence that a script is CRLF-clean.
The root `.gitattributes` pins `*.sh text eol=lf`, which overrides the
`core.autocrlf=true` default that Git for Windows installs. It pins `*.md` the
same way, because the frontmatter readers anchor on a `---` fence followed by a
Unix line ending and a CRLF checkout makes a document parse as having no
frontmatter, silently. Working copies cloned
before those pins need a one-time `git rm --cached -r . -q && git reset --hard` to
pick them up; see the Windows section of `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

Wallclock figures in the table above are from a Mac dev box. Windows is
substantially slower because each check pays full process-creation cost, and three
tree-walking checks (`check:privacy`, `check:test-names`, `check:test-isolation`)
plus `typecheck` can exceed the 120s per-check cap in `run-verify-parallel.sh`
there even though they pass on Linux and macOS.

### CI vs local: intentionally divergent file sets

- **CI matrix** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) runs `scripts/test-shard.sh` across 10 matrix shards partitioned by weight-aware LPT bin-packing (`scripts/sharding.ts`; files with no mined weight fall back to the p75 file weight so a new unweighted file can't silently unbalance a shard) and INCLUDES `*.slow.test.ts` (the four dedicated slow files — longmemeval, entity-resolve-perf, entity-card-perf, brainbench-e2e — run as dedicated jobs alongside the matrix) plus `evals/**/*.test.ts` (keyless-allowlist-gated — `test/scripts/evals-collection.test.ts`). Each shard's bun process is bounded by `--max-concurrency` (`GBRAIN_TEST_MAX_CONCURRENCY`, default 4). Every bun-test job — matrix shards, serial-tests, verify, the slow/eval jobs — activates the PGLite schema snapshot (built in-runner via `scripts/lib/test-env.sh`; the BrainBench gate uses the separate default-profile snapshot for its in-memory PGLite; the ~42MB tar is also cached across jobs via actions/cache, with the runner's own hash check staying authoritative). CI EXCLUDES `*.serial.test.ts` from the shards and runs them across four `serial-tests` workers via `bun run test:serial` — one bun process per file preserves the `mock.module` quarantine; the pool runs those processes concurrently. `bun run verify` gets its own job too, as does the BrainBench memory-conformance gate (`brainbench` job → `scripts/ci-brainbench-gate.sh`, hermetic in-memory PGLite, ~15s), which compares HEAD's fresh run against master's committed baseline (`evals/brainbench/baselines/main.json`) — the `test-status` aggregate checks its result explicitly. E2E (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`) always runs its applicable execution lanes, with the jsonb-parity job in front of tier2 as the token-spend gate, and aggregates through `e2e-status`. Scheduled runs also require the full-corpus lanes, including each slow suite excluded from the coverage shards (longmemeval, entity-resolve-perf, and brainbench-e2e). Both aggregates reject failures, cancellations, and unexpected skips. Dependency caches and validated PGLite snapshots remain; successful test results are never reused. CI is the ground truth for "did everything pass."
- **Local fast loop** (`scripts/run-unit-shard.sh` via the parallel wrapper) uses the same weighted partitioner as CI and EXCLUDES `*.slow.test.ts` AND `*.serial.test.ts`. Each shard runs its complete ordered selection with a fresh Bun process per file, without adding workers. Later groups still run after failures; missing summaries or file-completion evidence fail the shard. Local trades coverage for inner-loop speed; CI catches what local skips.

This divergence is intentional. Don't try to make them equal — the two scripts deliberately solve different problems. The regression test at `test/scripts/run-unit-shard.test.ts` pins what the local fast loop should and shouldn't include, and that no unit-lane file spawning the CLI through `test/helpers/cli-spawn.ts` hand-pins a per-test timeout below the bunfig default (an explicit `test(name, fn, N)` ceiling overrides bun's `--timeout`, so `GBRAIN_TEST_TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER` never reaches it — inherit the default instead; cli-spawn's own kill timer still reaps a hung child); `test/scripts/run-unit-parallel.test.ts` pins the wrapper's memory-adaptive concurrency, and the OOM/external-kill serial rescue pass, and operator-interrupt teardown (a Ctrl-C / SIGTERM to the wrapper while shards are live TERMs then KILLs every shard descendant, so a cancelled run cannot leave gtimeout/bun alive until the shard cap).

### Coverage lanes and gates

Line coverage is opt-in via `COVERAGE_DIR`: when set, the shell lanes
(`scripts/test-shard.sh`, `scripts/run-serial-tests.sh`, `scripts/run-e2e.sh`)
pass `--coverage --coverage-reporter=lcov` to bun; when unset, the exec line is
byte-identical to a non-coverage run. Every bun process gets its OWN coverage
dir (`$COVERAGE_DIR/shard`, `serial-$idx`, `e2e-$idx`) because a reused dir
silently overwrites `lcov.info` — the shard runner also pins xargs to a single
batch (`-n 100000 -x`) so an argv overflow fails loud instead of spawning a
second, overwriting bun process. On a green run each lane writes
`$COVERAGE_DIR/lane-manifest.json` (`{lane, sha, lcovCount, complete}`); a red
run writes no manifest, which downstream merging treats as an incomplete lane.
E2E shards use distinct `e2e-1` through `e2e-4` lane names (unsharded runs use
`e2e`), with an `executed-files.txt` receipt written only after every selected
file completes its native Bun report successfully. The runner requires a fresh
parent-owned JUnit report for the selected file and matching final console
pass/fail/skip totals. Python 3's standard XML parser validates the document
and checks its actual testcase counts against each suite and the console;
a zero exit without that report cannot borrow a nested child's summary as
completion evidence. Each coverage invocation atomically creates its own
`COVERAGE_DIR`; an existing destination, even an empty one, is refused without
changing its contents. Use a new path for a rerun. Failed or cancelled runs
write no completion receipt, and shorter or skip-only runs cannot inherit old
coverage or delete another run's outputs.
Skip-only files can emit no LCOV, so execution-file counts and LCOV counts are
intentionally different measures.
`run-e2e.sh` specifics: `COVERAGE_DIR` is normalized to an absolute path
against the repo root before `HOME` moves (the script redirects
`HOME`/`GBRAIN_HOME` and E2E tests spawn CLI subprocesses with varying cwd —
an un-normalized relative dir would scatter output), and `E2E_FILE_TIMEOUT_SECS`
caps each file's wallclock (default 180s; the nightly coverage lane uses 300s
for instrumentation overhead). Both env names are deliberately
non-`GBRAIN_`-prefixed so the hermetic env scrub keeps them.

**Two corpora.**

- **PR corpus** (`prCorpus`) — the 17 coverage-collecting lanes in
  `.github/workflows/test.yml`: the 10 matrix shards, four `serial-tests` partitions, and the
  three dedicated slow jobs (`slow-eval-longmemeval`,
  `slow-entity-resolve-perf`, `slow-brainbench-e2e`). Deterministic (runs identically on every PR); this
  is the corpus the gates run against.
- **fullCorpus** — nightly or explicit manual opt-in in `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`:
  `coverage-full-{unit,serial,slow,e2e}` + `coverage-full-report`. Fully
  self-contained (every lane re-runs with coverage inside that workflow,
  including the full default E2E discovery across four isolated Postgres
  workers) — the honest
  merged unit+serial+slow+e2e number, kept as the `coverage-full-merged` trend
  artifact.

The E2E workflow's manual `full_corpus` boolean defaults to `false`. Setting it
to `true` executes the same full unit/serial/slow/E2E profile, report and receipt
checks as a schedule; selected E2E receives the same explicit empty sentinel.
Ordinary pushes, PRs and default manual runs retain their existing selection.
Explicit full manual runs have a separate concurrency group, so they do not
cancel ordinary validation on the same branch. To measure a branch before the
next scheduled run, dispatch `e2e.yml` on that branch with `full_corpus=true`.

The nightly E2E artifacts are `coverage-full-e2e-1` through `-4`, with one
manifest per artifact and one coverage directory per Bun process. Lightweight
`e2e-full-execution-*` artifacts also carry the manifest and executed-file list.
Full-profile `e2e-status` requires the matrix job to succeed and validates all four
same-commit receipts against the exact expected partitions using
`scripts/verify-nightly-e2e.ts`. Missing artifacts, duplicate identities, wrong
commits, omitted or repeated files, failures and cancellations cannot report
complete execution. The report independently verifies these receipts before
merging; missing execution evidence prevents publishing a full-corpus report.
Coverage percentages remain advisory and the report job itself is not an
`e2e-status` dependency. The receipts prove file execution, not execution of
every optional assertion within a file.

**Merge** (`scripts/merge-lcov.ts`). Walks the input dirs for `lcov.info` +
`lane-manifest.json`, sums DA hits per file:line, normalizes paths
repo-relative, and emits a merged lcov plus a summary JSON: src-only
totals/per-dir/per-file percentages, a `lineHits` map (the diff gate's input),
and the never-loaded src file list. `--manifest-expect lane,lane,...` pins the
expected lane set (`serial-1` through `serial-4` for PRs, `serial` nightly,
and `e2e-1` through `e2e-4` nightly).
The merger checks commit SHA (`--sha` overrides checkout HEAD for offline
artifacts), duplicate identities, and actual per-lane LCOV counts; a missing or `complete: false` manifest, an unparseable
lcov, or a `shard` lane with `lcovCount != 1` marks the summary
`degraded: true`. Degraded is data, not failure: the merge never aborts (exit
0), and both gates print `WOULD PASS`/`WOULD FAIL` and exit 0 on a degraded
summary instead of enforcing against partial data.

**Diff gate** (`scripts/coverage-diff-gate.ts`). Gates the added/changed lines
of `git diff origin/master...HEAD` restricted to gate scope (`src/**.ts` minus
`*.test.ts`/`*.generated.ts`/`*.d.ts`): covered/(covered+uncovered) must be
≥ 80%, AND no gate-scoped changed file may be entirely absent from the
coverage data (a never-loaded file is one violation — add a test that imports
it). Non-executable lines (no lcov record) don't count against you; empty and
doc-only diffs short-circuit to PASS via the `select-e2e` classifier. Escape
hatches: a commit body containing `[coverage-exempt: reason]` passes with a
loud warning, and `scripts/coverage-gate-exemptions.txt` (exact path or
trailing-`/` prefix per line; resolved via
`git show origin/master:scripts/coverage-gate-exemptions.txt`, never the
working tree, so a PR cannot self-exempt; SHRINK-ONLY — additions need a
graduation review in the PR description) excludes paths from the gate while
still reporting them
(`[e2e-exempt]`, `[subprocess-undercount]`). Report-only unless
`COVERAGE_GATE_ENFORCE=1`. Exit contract: 0 = pass or report-only, 1 = gate
fail while enforcing, 2 = infrastructure error (missing summary, git failure —
never conflated with a coverage verdict).

**Baseline gate** (`scripts/coverage-baseline-gate.ts`). Anti-erosion floor:
reads the baseline via `git show origin/master:scripts/coverage-baseline.json`
— the master copy, never the working tree, so a PR cannot weaken its own bar —
and compares like-for-like by corpus (`--corpus prCorpus` in test.yml,
`--corpus fullCorpus` nightly). A global drop > 0.5pp, a per-directory drop
> 1.0pp, or a never-loaded-count increase fails (deleting tests shrinks the
coverage denominator, which inflates pct for free); a corpus section that is
`null` on master is an ungated first landing. `provisional: true` in the baseline keeps the gate report-only
regardless of enforcement — the committed baseline is currently provisional
with both corpus sections unseeded. `scripts/update-coverage-baseline.ts
--summary <json> --corpus <c> [--promote]` writes the working-tree baseline
(per-file detail limited to the baseline's `watchlist`); `--promote` flips
`provisional: false` at graduation.

**CI wiring.** The 17 PR lanes upload `coverage-*` artifacts; the advisory
`coverage-report` job downloads + merges (`COVERAGE_CORPUS=prCorpus`), renders
`scripts/render-coverage-summary.ts` to the step summary (including the
behavioral-vs-structural counts from `scripts/structural-suites.tsv`), and
runs both gates with `COVERAGE_GATE_ENFORCE: '0'`. It is deliberately NOT in
`test-status` needs — it cannot block a PR until graduation. Test results are
never cached: every run executes its required checks, while Bun dependencies
and validated PGLite snapshots remain cached. Gitleaks runs independently for
all changes, including documentation. `e2e-status` also requires the four
`coverage-full-*` execution lanes on scheduled runs; only coverage percentage
reporting remains advisory.

**Bun caveats.** Bun/JSC emits line records only, so function coverage is
informational (no reliable function names). There is NO subprocess coverage:
code exercised only through spawned CLI subprocesses undercounts — `src/cli.ts`
carries a permanent `[subprocess-undercount]` exemption for this. A src file
never imported by any test produces no lcov record at all; the summary reports
these as a count + sorted list, deliberately never a percentage (physical
lines ≠ executable lines), and the diff gate treats a changed-but-never-loaded
file as a violation.

**One-command local smoke** (one shard of ten, so totals reflect a tenth of
the corpus — this checks the plumbing, not the number):

```bash
COVERAGE_DIR=$PWD/.coverage bash scripts/test-shard.sh 1 10 \
  && bun scripts/merge-lcov.ts --out-lcov .coverage/merged.lcov --out-json .coverage/summary.json .coverage \
  && bun scripts/render-coverage-summary.ts --summary .coverage/summary.json
```

Optional flags: `coverage-diff-gate.ts --base <ref>` overrides the diff base
(default `origin/master`); `render-coverage-summary.ts --structural
scripts/structural-suites.tsv` adds the behavioral-vs-structural split to the
rendered summary (both CI lanes pass it); `classify-tests.ts --summary` prints
counts only.

### Failure-first logging

When `bun run test` finds any failure, the wrapper:

1. Writes failure blocks (each prefixed with `--- shard N: <test name> ---`) to `.context/test-failures.log` (workspace-local, gitignored). On systems without a writable `.context/`, falls back to `/tmp/gbrain-test-failures.log`.
2. Prints a loud stderr banner with the absolute log path, plus the last 30 lines of the failure log inlined. Banner survives `| head` / `| tail` / agent-side log truncation.
3. Writes a one-line-per-shard summary to `.context/test-summary.txt` (`shard N/M: pass=X fail=Y skip=Z rc=W`).
4. Exits non-zero. Empty failure log + non-zero exit = infrastructure problem (wedged shard, killed child); the banner says so.

If a shard hits the per-shard `GBRAIN_TEST_SHARD_TIMEOUT` cap (default 3000s — sized so the heaviest count-balanced shard finishes under 4-way contention; `GBRAIN_TEST_SHARD_KILL_AFTER` sets the grace after TERM before KILL, default 30s), the wrapper classifies the kill one of two ways:

- **EXIT-HANG → warn-pass.** If the shard's log had been silent for ≥300s at kill time AND shows zero `(fail)` markers, the shard finished all its work, leaked a handle, and never exited (a known PGLite-adjacent handle leak — see TODOS.md "unit-shard exit hang"). The wrapper prints a `⚠️ shard N/M: EXIT-HANG ... Treating as pass-with-warning` banner, writes `EXIT-HANG (idle Ns, 0 fails) ... warn-pass` to the summary, and does NOT fail the run. Its pass counts are undercounted (bun never printed its final summary). Bun's per-test `--timeout` turns a genuinely hung TEST into a printed `(fail)` — new output — so this classification cannot mask a hung test; the residual maskable case is a file-level import hang in the very last file, which the banner keeps visible.
- **WEDGED → hard failure.** Anything else (failures present, or the log was still growing) writes `--- shard N: WEDGED after ${SHARD_TIMEOUT}s ---` to the failure log with the last 50 lines of the shard log, marks the run failed, and proceeds with other shards' results.

Triage rule: a `warn-pass` EXIT-HANG line in `.context/test-summary.txt` is NOT a test failure — don't burn time bisecting it; a `WEDGED` line is.

### File taxonomy

- `*.test.ts` → fast loop (parallel up-to-4-shard fan-out, memory-adaptive).
- `*.slow.test.ts` → run via `bun run test:slow` only (intentional cold-path tests; would dominate the fast loop's wallclock).
- `*.serial.test.ts` → run via `bun run test:serial` after the parallel pass completes; one bun process per file (`--max-concurrency=1` within a shared process is not enough — the module registry still leaks `mock.module`), with those per-file processes POOLED (per-process isolation never required one-at-a-time execution). Files touching machine-global state (launchd/cron) live on the sequential `EXCLUSIVE_FILES` lane inside `scripts/run-serial-tests.sh` — growth-guarded to ≤3 entries with justification comments. Quarantine for tests that share file-wide state and race when run alongside other files in the same `bun test` process. Several dozen files, discovered by the `*.serial.test.ts` glob — no list to maintain. Typical residents: `mock.module(...)` users (top-level mocks leak across files in a shard process, e.g. `test/embed.serial.test.ts`), env-coupled files (e.g. `test/brain-registry.serial.test.ts`), and process-lifecycle suites that assert on `process.exitCode` (e.g. `test/pglite-engine-disconnect.serial.test.ts`). **Do not put the parallelism back on a serial file unless you've fixed the contention root cause** (it just re-introduces the flake).
- `test/e2e/*.test.ts` → real-Postgres E2E. Skipped when `DATABASE_URL` is unset. One out-of-directory file rides this lane: `test/phantom-redirect-engine-parity.test.ts` (lives in `test/` for its PGLite arm, but its Postgres arm is only reachable through a DATABASE_URL-bearing lane — the unit wrappers strip the URL, so `run-e2e.sh`'s no-args list and CI's parity job carry it). `run-e2e.sh` wraps each file in a hard outer timeout (default 180s; `GBRAIN_E2E_FILE_TIMEOUT=<seconds>` overrides) because a synchronously-blocking PGLite WASM call can outlive bun's timer-based `--timeout`; LLM-bound Tier-2 files (`skills.test.ts`) automatically get 4× the cap since real provider round-trips legitimately run past 180s.
- `tests/heavy/*.sh` → ops-shape shell scripts. Cost minutes per run; NOT in default `bun test`. Run via `bun run test:heavy` or scheduled nightly via `.github/workflows/heavy-tests.yml`. Examples: pg_upgrade matrix (boot legacy brain → walk to head), RSS budget gate (measure peak worker RSS vs committed baseline), read-latency-under-sync (p50/p95/p99 under concurrent writer load), sync lock regression (N concurrent syncs assert 1 winner + N-1 lock-busy + zero leaked `gbrain_cycle_locks` rows). See `tests/heavy/README.md` for when to add a script here vs `*.slow.test.ts`. Files prefixed with `_` (e.g. `tests/heavy/_build_legacy_fixtures.sh`) are helpers/libs invoked by sibling tests — the runner skips them.
- `test/fuzz/*.test.ts` → property-based fuzz harness. Pure-validator targets in `pure-validators.test.ts` are guarded by `scripts/check-fuzz-purity.sh` (in `bun run verify`), which `bun build --target=bun` bundles each target and greps the resulting bundle for banned transitive imports (`node:fs`, `node:child_process`, engine modules). Anything that fails the guard moves to `mixed-validators.test.ts` (still property-tested, but no purity guarantee) or `filesystem-validators.test.ts` (fs-backed, uses temp dirs). Fuzz tests run in the default `bun test` loop because they're fast (~3s for ~12 properties × 1000 runs each).

The taxonomy above is LANE-based (where a test runs). A second, orthogonal axis is INTENT:

- **Behavioral** tests execute product code and assert on behavior — the default.
- **Structural** (source-shape) suites read repo source/doc TEXT and assert on its shape (wiring guards, drift pins, `doctorSource()` consumers). They are real invariants but execute no product paths, so they inflate the headline test count without adding line coverage. The committed inventory is `scripts/structural-suites.tsv`, generated by `scripts/classify-tests.ts` (suite-level, content-based detectors: repo-anchored `readFileSync`/`Bun.file` readers, grep-style exec scanners, the doctor-source helpers) and freshness-checked in `bun run verify` (`check:structural-manifest` — regenerate with `bun scripts/classify-tests.ts` when suites change shape). The inventory is approximate by design; fix misclassifications in the classifier's detector list, never by hand-editing the TSV. CI's coverage report renders behavioral vs structural counts side by side.

Guards that pin doctor source text read it through `test/helpers/doctor-source.ts` (`doctorSource()` = the façade + every `src/commands/doctor/**` module, for containment assertions; `doctorFileSource(rel)` = one named file, for positional/ordering assertions) so peeling doctor.ts into modules can't silently move a pinned string out of a guard's sight.

### TTY and interactive-CLI testing

Four escalating tools; reach for the cheapest one that answers the question:

| Question | Tool | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Does the TTY/non-TTY branch logic pick right? | Inject `isTTY` into the pure function — no subprocess | `test/init-provider-picker.test.ts`, `test/jobs-watch-mode.test.ts` |
| Does the real CLI behave right when stdin is NOT a terminal? | Spawn the CLI with piped/ignored stdio | `test/cli-stdin-hang.test.ts` (fast loop); `test/e2e/init-fresh-pglite.test.ts` (manual `test:e2e` lane — see the TODOS e2e CI-lane entry) |
| Does the real CLI render menus and read typed input under a REAL terminal? | `launchTty` from `test/helpers/tty-harness.ts` in a `*.serial.test.ts` file | `test/init-picker-pty.serial.test.ts` |
| How does the install FEEL (stalls, copy, silence windows)? | `scripts/dx-explore.ts` — instrument, not a test; nothing asserts | transcripts under `.context/dx-runs/` (see `docs/guides/bootstrap.md`) |

Real-PTY test rules: put the file in the serial lane (`*.serial.test.ts` — that
lane runs in required CI; a new `test/e2e/*` file does NOT, since unit shards
exclude the directory and the e2e workflow runs only explicitly named files,
no glob);
assert NON-default picker values (bare Enter and each prompt's 60s
`readLineSafe` timeout both resolve to the default, so a defaults-asserting
test passes with dead input); always `await session.close()` in a `finally`
(only `close()` clears the harness wall timer); and point `HOME` plus
`GBRAIN_HOME` at a temp root with pass-through auth keys stripped via
`dropEnv` so picker state is machine-independent.

### Skills-manifest freshness guard

`skills/skills.lock.json` is a committed sha256 inventory of every bundled file under
`skills/` (tamper evidence, not signatures — see `src/core/skills-integrity.ts`).
Any change under `skills/` must regenerate it: `bun run scripts/generate-skills-manifest.ts`.
`scripts/check-skills-manifest-fresh.sh` (`bun run check:skills-manifest`, wired into
`bun run verify`) regenerates to a tmp file and diffs, failing CI on drift; at runtime
`gbrain doctor` reports the same drift as a warn-only `skills_manifest_integrity` check.

### Test-isolation lint and helpers

**This section is the canonical home of the test-isolation discipline** — CONTRIBUTING.md and other docs link here rather than restating the rules.

The cross-file flake class is enforced statically by `scripts/check-test-isolation.sh`, wired into `bun run verify`. Rules (non-serial unit files only; `*.serial.test.ts` and `test/e2e/*` are skipped):

| Rule | What it bans | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **R1** | `process.env.X = ...`, bracket assignment, `delete process.env.X`, `Object.assign(process.env, ...)`, `Reflect.set(process.env, ...)` | Use `withEnv()` from `test/helpers/with-env.ts`, OR rename file to `*.serial.test.ts` |
| **R2** | `mock.module(...)` anywhere in the file | Rename file to `*.serial.test.ts` (no DI on production code for testability) |
| **R3** | `new PGLiteEngine(` outside ~50 lines after a `beforeAll(` line | Use the canonical block (below) inside `beforeAll(` |
| **R4** | Files creating `new PGLiteEngine(` without `engine.disconnect(` inside an `afterAll(` block | Add `afterAll(() => engine.disconnect())` |

Files that violated these rules at the isolation-lint baseline are listed in `scripts/check-test-isolation.allowlist`. **The allow-list MUST shrink over time** — never add new entries.

#### Canonical PGLite block (R3 + R4 compliant)

Every test file that needs a PGLite engine should use this exact pattern:

```ts
import { PGLiteEngine } from '../src/core/pglite-engine.ts';
import { resetPgliteState } from './helpers/reset-pglite.ts';

let engine: PGLiteEngine;

beforeAll(async () => {
  engine = new PGLiteEngine();
  await engine.connect({});
  await engine.initSchema();
});

afterAll(async () => {
  await engine.disconnect();
});

beforeEach(async () => {
  await resetPgliteState(engine);
});
```

Why this exact shape: `beforeAll` creates a single engine per file (PGLite WASM cold-start + initSchema is ~20s); `beforeEach` clears user data via `resetPgliteState`; `afterAll` disconnects so the engine doesn't leak across file boundaries within a shard process. Ordinary resets atomically delete rows with cleanup-only trigger suppression and restart owned sequences, retaining table/index storage. The helper restores trigger behavior before reseeding and falls back to `TRUNCATE CASCADE` for schemas whose triggers, rules, inheritance, external foreign keys or privileges require its original semantics. Schema/generation infrastructure survives, and each reset rotates the logical brain identity.

Every full reset measures aggregate target-table storage, including indexes and
TOAST, with `pg_total_relation_size`. Above 8 MiB it uses the same atomic TRUNCATE
path to reclaim storage; no reset counter or stale size estimate is retained.
The helper regression suite checks repeated TOAST-heavy resets, cleanup and
sequence parity, restored triggers and foreign-key enforcement.

#### `withEnv` pattern (R1 fix)

```ts
import { withEnv } from './helpers/with-env.ts';

test('reads OPENAI_API_KEY', async () => {
  await withEnv({ OPENAI_API_KEY: 'sk-test' }, async () => {
    expect(loadConfig().openai_key).toBe('sk-test');
  });
});

// Delete a var (override is undefined):
await withEnv({ GBRAIN_HOME: undefined }, fn);

// Multiple keys:
await withEnv({ A: '1', B: '2', C: undefined }, fn);
```

`withEnv` saves the prior value of every key it touches and restores via try/finally — including when the callback throws. **It is cross-test safe but NOT intra-file concurrent-safe.** `process.env` is process-global; two `test.concurrent()` calls in the same file both touching the same key will race. Files using `withEnv` stay outside the `test.concurrent()` codemod's eligibility filter.

#### Speed + environment helpers (`test/helpers/`)

Reach for these before hand-rolling; the five speed helpers each have their
own unit test, and the two environment probes are exercised through their
consumer suites:

- `cli-spawn.ts` — `runCli(argv, opts)` (async, hermetic env, timeout-killed),
  `runCliBatch(argvs, {width})` (bounded pool, DEFAULT WIDTH 2 — the cap is
  per-invocation and 4 shards × width multiplies CLI children machine-wide;
  each child can boot a ~1.5GB PGLite), `runCliMemo` (argv-keyed memo for
  read-only calls like `--help`; `clearCliMemo()` drops the memo when a test
  mutates what a memoized call would observe). Replaces the per-file spawn wrappers; a file
  of N independent sequential spawns becomes one width-2 batch in `beforeAll`.
- `wait-for.ts` — `waitFor(predicate, {timeoutMs, intervalMs})` /
  `waitForValue`. Replaces fixed `setTimeout` sleeps: polls resolve as soon as
  the condition holds, and generous deadlines make slow-CI runs LESS flaky
  than a tuned sleep, not more.
- `with-snapshot.ts` — `withColdPglite(fn)`: per-TEST scoped
  `GBRAIN_PGLITE_SNAPSHOT` opt-out (save/delete/restore);
  `withSnapshotValue(value, fn)` is the general form (pin any snapshot path
  for fn's scope; `undefined` = deleted). Use instead of a
  file-level `delete process.env.GBRAIN_PGLITE_SNAPSHOT`, which forces every
  engine in the file to cold-boot. Caution: a snapshot-restored engine does
  not replay migrations on a later `initSchema()` after a version rewind —
  rewind-arc tests need the cold path (see `test/bootstrap.test.ts`).
- `reset-pglite.ts#resetPgliteStateNarrow(engine, tables)` — explicit-table
  truncate for hot loops (the full reset clears the whole catalog). The
  table list is REQUIRED — a default would silently under-truncate.
- `git-fixture.ts` — `makeGitFixture(dir)`: build-once git repo +
  `reset()`/`commitAll()` between tests, replacing per-test `git init` chains.
- `fs-perms.ts` — `permsEnforced()` / `crontabAvailable()` probes: some hosts
  (FUSE/overlay sandboxes, root) don't enforce permission bits or lack a
  crontab; tests asserting "this write MUST fail" / "cron registered" use
  `test.skipIf(!probe())` so they skip visibly there and still run in CI.
- `git-stderr-probe.ts` — `gitStderrLeads()`: skips raw-git-stderr-slice
  assertions behind ambient git PATH shims that print their own diagnostics
  first (e.g. Conductor's auth-broker wrapper).

#### When to quarantine instead of fix

Rename to `*.serial.test.ts` when:
- The file uses `mock.module(...)` (R2 — there's no clean fix without changing production code).
- The file is genuinely env-coupled (e.g. `gbrain-home-isolation.test.ts`, `claw-test-cli.test.ts`) — module-load env readers + ESM caching defeat dynamic-import-after-env tricks.
- The file's tests intentionally share state across `it()` boundaries.

The quarantine has grown to dozens of files — treat it as debt: every addition needs a reason from the list above, and prefer fixing the contention root cause when one exists.

### Unit test inventory

`bun test` runs all tests without a database. E2E tests skip gracefully when `DATABASE_URL` is not set.

**GBRAIN_HOME isolation preload.** `test/helpers/gbrain-home-preload.ts` (bunfig
`[test]` preload) points `GBRAIN_HOME` at a per-run scratch dir when it isn't
already set, so unit tests never read — or clobber — the operator's real
`~/.gbrain` config/brain. Without it, any config-honoring code path silently
changes behavior with whatever the live `config.json` says. The
canonical GBRAIN_HOME convention is `config.ts:configDir()`: GBRAIN_HOME is a
PARENT dir and `.gbrain` is appended. Subprocess-spawning tests must set BOTH
`HOME: tmp` and `GBRAIN_HOME: tmp` in the child env (HOME alone loses to the
inherited preload value; in-process HOME mutation loses to Bun's cached
`os.homedir()`). The e2e wrapper sets its own GBRAIN_HOME before bun starts,
which this preload respects. Because the preload respects a pre-set value, the
unit/slow wrappers (`run-unit-parallel.sh` / `run-unit-shard.sh` /
`run-slow-tests.sh`) strip an ambient `GBRAIN_HOME` at their boundary — same
discipline as the database-URL vars — so a dev shell configured for a real
brain can't ride through. `GBRAIN_DEBUG_PRELOAD=1` prints the allocated
scratch home for debugging.

Installer fixtures must never delete `GBRAIN_HOME` to test a fallback against
the operator's home. Spawn a disposable child with HOME set before Bun starts,
then set GBRAIN_HOME to the specific fixture. `real-home-guard-preload.ts`
compares metadata for the real-home autopilot wrapper, env file, start script,
launchd plist and systemd unit around tests. It detects changes rather than
intercepting writes and never reads env-file contents. A deliberate one-shot
installer test can explicitly set `GBRAIN_TEST_ALLOW_REAL_HOME_WRITES=1`, which
prints a warning; use that only inside an independently isolated child home.
`test/real-home-guard-preload.test.ts` runs the installer suite with fake-live
sentinels and verifies they are untouched.

**Provider-key strip preload.** `test/helpers/provider-keys-preload.ts` (bunfig
`[test]` preload) strips the ambient provider credentials the canonical fold
recognizes, using the explicit `test/helpers/provider-env.ts` list checked
against every recipe credential/endpoint plus compatibility aliases, and
defaults `GBRAIN_MODEL_DISCOVERY=off` (respecting an explicit operator
override), so key-aware model routing (`resolveTierDefault`) resolves
identically to keyless CI and latest-model discovery never makes a real
network call from a test. Without it, a chat key exported in the dev shell
flips default-model assertions AND turns gated paths into live provider calls.
Tests that want keys inject them explicitly
(`configureGateway({env})`, `withEnv`, serial-file `process.env`) — the
preload removes ambient shell state only, before any test file loads. The e2e
wrapper (`scripts/run-e2e.sh`) opts back in at its boundary via
`GBRAIN_TEST_KEEP_PROVIDER_KEYS=1` — e2e is the lane where real keys are
deliberate (live embed/parity tests skip-gate on them). The routing-only
`qm-provisioning`, `serve-http-surface-ceiling`, `serve-stdio-roundtrip` and
`thin-client` fixtures still strip provider state in every child, set both
`HOME` and `GBRAIN_HOME` to their temporary brain, and pass Bun
`--no-env-file` (including provisioned shell commands). They exercise routing
without spending provider tokens even inside the keyed nightly lane.
Fixture-specific environment overrides apply last; unrelated credentials are
preserved rather than removed with a broad key-name pattern.

**Database-URL run guard.** A `bun test` invocation REFUSES to start while
`DATABASE_URL` or `GBRAIN_DATABASE_URL` is ambient in the environment, because some
tests run destructive SQL against whatever those URLs point at (a bare `bun test`
with `~/.gbrain/.env` sourced would run them against a real brain). The guard is a bunfig
`[test]` preload (`test/helpers/database-url-guard-preload.ts`); it hard-fails with
instructions rather than silently unsetting (a silent unset would turn
DATABASE_URL-gated e2e tests into green skips). The e2e wrappers
(`scripts/run-e2e.sh`, the e2e/heavy workflows) opt in at their own boundary via
`GBRAIN_TEST_ALLOW_DATABASE_URL=1`; the unit/slow wrappers instead strip both
URL vars at their boundary (unit tests need no database), which keeps
`bun run test:full` working with DATABASE_URL exported. Caveat: bun loads
`bunfig.toml` from the invocation cwd, so the preload layer only applies to
runs started at the repo root — the per-file name floor below is the layer
that doesn't care about cwd. Two more layers apply after the opt-in: every
test that runs destructive SQL on the ambient URL must call
`assertSafeE2eDatabaseUrl()` (`test/helpers/db-guard.ts` — name floor: the database
name must contain "test" as a segment, or be opted in via `GBRAIN_E2E_ALLOW_DB`)
or carry an inline name floor the coverage gate recognizes
(`test/e2e/schema-drift.test.ts` keeps its own `looksLikeTestDb`, deliberately
different because it also accepts `*_e2e`), and `test/db-guard-coverage.test.ts`
statically scans the suite and fails when a file connects to `DATABASE_URL` and
runs destructive SQL unguarded. Local CI explicitly sets `GBRAIN_TEST_DB=1`
for its known Docker E2E databases, and `run-e2e.sh` preserves that opt-in so
schema-drift can reset stale fixture schemas on service-name hosts. The hard
test-database name floor still applies; this flag only relaxes the localhost
requirement. The heavy shell lane gets the same floor outside
bun: `tests/heavy/_db_floor.sh` (sourced by `scripts/run-heavy.sh` for the whole
lane, and by each database-touching heavy script itself, since scripts are
documented for direct invocation — the PGLite-based heavy scripts unset the URL
instead) checks BOTH URL variables and strips query strings before extracting
the database name, so a `?host=/tmp/test-sockets` parameter can't smuggle a
test-shaped segment past it.

Unit tests and what they cover:

- `test/facts-engine.test.ts` / `test/consolidate-valid-until.test.ts` — facts-list filtering and consolidate correctness: `unconsolidatedOnly` is applied before the 100-row limit, so newer consolidated facts cannot permanently hide older pending facts; the phase regression seeds 100 consolidated rows plus three older pending rows and requires all three to progress.
- `test/markdown.test.ts` — frontmatter parsing; `splitBody` sentinel precedence, horizontal-rule preservation, `inferType` wiki subtypes.
- `test/chunkers/recursive.test.ts` — chunking.
- `test/parity.test.ts` — operations contract parity.
- `test/cli.test.ts` — CLI structure.
- `test/cli-finish-teardown.test.ts` — the CLI teardown contract: `computeTeardownDeadlineMs` formula/floor/live-registry scaling + `GBRAIN_TEARDOWN_DEADLINE_MS` override (garbage/zero/negative values fall back to the formula); `finishCliTeardown` clean path (drain BEFORE disconnect, no exit, no warn), backstop on hung drain or disconnect (honors an errored op's exit code), throwing drain/disconnect warned + swallowed; the gbrain-owned verdict channel is immune to PGLite WASM `process.exitCode` writes; `flushThenExit` unit coverage with mocked streams (exits once after both stream callbacks, non-TTY aliveness grace, blocked-pipe guard, EPIPE-safe, `GBRAIN_FLUSH_GRACE_MS` override).
- `test/flush-then-exit-harness.test.ts` — real spawned-Bun pipe semantics for `flushThenExit` (fixture: `test/fixtures/flush-then-exit-harness.ts`): a 4MB piped stdout payload arrives byte-complete with the exit code even with a late reader, small output survives exit with a concurrent reader, and the fence resolves promptly (wall time well under the guard + grace ceiling).
- `test/cli-should-force-exit.test.ts` — `shouldForceExitAfterMain` daemon-survival gate: `serve` (stdio and `--http`) never force-exits, including with preceding global flags; op commands / empty / flag-only argv do; space-separated global-flag VALUES can't fake a command (`--timeout 30s serve` resolves to the `serve` daemon, not a `30s` command).
- `test/cli-exit-verdict-pin.test.ts` — structural class pin: greps `src/` so the NEXT raw `process.exitCode =` write fails CI (a raw write bypasses the gbrain-owned verdict channel and gets silently zeroed by the deliberate flush-exit, which would make a FAIL path exit 0). Runtime variants live in `test/cli-finish-teardown.test.ts`; this is the review-time guard.
- `test/cli-pipe-truncation.test.ts` — real-CLI pipe completeness, implementation-agnostic: the actual CLI run the way agents run it (piped stdout) produces complete, parseable, byte-stable `--tools-json` output and exits deliberately, well under the teardown backstop. Synthetic flush-mechanism coverage stays in `test/flush-then-exit-harness.test.ts`.
- `test/volunteer-context.test.ts` — push-based context core, hermetic in-memory PGLite: `parseWindow` lenient `user:`/`assistant:` parsing, multi-turn window extraction, confidence-gated volunteering (arm confidences, multi-turn/newest-turn boosts, `min_confidence` gate, max-pages cap), slug-only suppression, privacy (rationales are deterministic templates; synopses pass the takes/facts fence), and the approximate usage-stats join.
- `test/watch-command.test.ts` — `gbrain watch` push transport: streaming loop, rolling window, session dedupe, `--json` JSONL shape, `channel: 'watch'` event logging, clean EOF return. Hermetic PGLite + injected line/write deps (no subprocess, no real stdin).
- `test/watch-sigint.serial.test.ts` — `gbrain watch` SIGINT lifecycle against a real spawned CLI subprocess with a tmpdir brain. SERIAL: parallel unit shards flake on concurrent subprocess spawns (same rationale as `apply-migrations-pglite-spawn.serial.test.ts`).
- `test/init-picker-pty.serial.test.ts` — the interactive `gbrain init` pickers (embedding-provider + search-mode) driven under a REAL pseudo-terminal via `launchTty`: typed input lands (a NON-default mode choice verified by a follow-up non-TTY config read — bare Enter and the `readLineSafe` timeout both resolve to defaults, so a defaults-asserting test would pass with dead input), prompt-to-acknowledgement gaps bounded well under the fallback window, plus the Ctrl-D/EOF keyless fallback. On CI, missing PTY support fails loud instead of skipping. Hermetic: HOME + GBRAIN_HOME at a temp root, pass-through auth keys stripped via `dropEnv`; `session.close()` in `finally`. Serial: PTY spawn + full PGLite bootstrap, and the serial lane is what runs in required CI.
- `test/tty-harness.test.ts` — the real-PTY harness's pure helpers (`stripAnsi`, `computeStalls`, `renderStallsReport`, `parseDriveCommand`, `buildClaudeTuiSeed`) with zero subprocesses; the file's live-PTY smokes are `describe.skipIf(!ptySupported())`-gated.
- `test/autopilot-launchd-lifecycle.serial.test.ts` — autopilot lifecycle behavior, not generated-string assertions: the full install → self-disable → status → reinstall → uninstall arc with `launchctl` replaced by an argv recorder and the generated wrapper executed by a REAL bash against a genuinely deleted repo (every platform), plus a darwin-only fail-SKIP describe against the real launchd under a per-run unique label (`GBRAIN_AUTOPILOT_LABEL`) so it can never collide with — or tear down — a real install on the host. Serial: spawns subprocesses and pins HOME/GBRAIN_HOME for the whole file.
- `test/autopilot-fanout.test.ts` — Autopilot fan-out and policy pins: targeted idempotency keys reopen per dispatch interval while stable doctor/remediate keys remain unchanged; the 60-minute full-cycle floor wins with a remaining small plan, and an all-fresh restart check advances the process-local clock without masking failed stale-source submissions.
- `test/agent-scheduler-contract.serial.test.ts` — the documented external agent-scheduler shell chain (`gbrain sync --repo X && gbrain embed --stale`, live-sync.md / INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md Step 7) driven end-to-end through a real `/bin/sh` against a keyless PGLite brain: the `&&` short-circuit IS the contract (argv arrays can't exercise it), the keyless bare stale embed exits 0, and the pull-failure case that must break the chain does. Anti-vacuity: the fixture commits a real page and every read-back asserts pages >= 1. Serial: real spawned CLI + tmpdir HOME.
- `test/cli-format-volunteer.test.ts` — `formatResult`'s `volunteer_context` human rendering: pointer lines with confidence/arm/rationale, the empty-result message, the approximate stats summary.
- `test/config.test.ts` — config redaction.
- `test/files.test.ts` — MIME/hash.
- `test/import-file.test.ts` — import pipeline.
- `test/upgrade.serial.test.ts` — the `gbrain upgrade` command via subprocess: `--help` prints usage and exits 0, install-method detection, `resolveBunGlobalRoot`, and the self-upgrade marker format (serial: spawns the real CLI).
- `test/file-migration.test.ts` — file migration.
- `test/file-resolver.test.ts` — file resolution.
- `test/import-resume.test.ts` — import checkpoints.
- `test/migrate.test.ts` — migration: v8/v9 helper-btree-index SQL structural assertions; 1000-row wall-clock fixtures pinning O(n log n) behavior; v12/v13 SQL shape; `sqlFor` + `transaction:false` runner semantics; the `max_stalled DEFAULT 1` regression guard; v24 `sqlFor.pglite: ''` no-op assertion; v117 `context_volunteer_events` (named + idempotent entry, documented columns + both source-scoped indexes after `initSchema`, insert + 90-day `purgeStaleVolunteerEvents` round-trip).
- `test/bootstrap.test.ts` — bootstrap contract: no-op on fresh install, idempotent across two `initSchema()` calls, no-op on modern brain that already has every probed column, full bootstrap path on a simulated legacy brain, fresh-install regression guard, legacy `links` shape coverage.
- `test/schema-bootstrap-coverage.test.ts` — CI guard covering BOTH embedded schema blobs: neither may forward-reference state its engine's bootstrap can't create, and a reference covered on one blob is NOT automatically covered on the other (`dream_verdicts` exists only in the Postgres blob). PGLite half: `REQUIRED_BOOTSTRAP_COVERAGE` lists every forward reference in `PGLITE_SCHEMA_SQL`; the test fails loudly if `applyForwardReferenceBootstrap` skips one (extend both arrays when adding a column-with-index to the embedded schema blob). Also parses `src/core/migrate.ts` source text for every `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` (top-level `sql:`, `sqlFor.{postgres,pglite}` overrides, AND handler-body `engine.runMigration(N, \`ALTER TABLE ...\`)`) and asserts each (table, column) pair is covered by the bootstrap OR by the schema blob's CREATE TABLE bodies — catching the column-only forward-reference class (e.g. `sources.archived`, `oauth_clients.source_id`) that a CREATE INDEX parser alone can't see. Postgres half (the class-closure gate): parses every CREATE INDEX column reference in `SCHEMA_SQL` and requires each to be in the blob's CREATE TABLE body AND not migration-added, or probed + ALTERed by `src/core/postgres-engine/forward-reference-bootstrap.ts` — a column that is both in the blob's CREATE TABLE and migration-added is still a forward reference for pre-existing brains, where `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` no-ops and the blob's CREATE INDEX wedges `initSchema` before migrations can help. This gate is parser-driven (no registry to extend); intentional non-probes go in `POSTGRES_INDEX_REF_EXEMPTIONS` with a rationale. Honest scope: CREATE INDEX column references only — constraints, views, and trigger bodies are a filed TODOS.md follow-up. `parseBaseTableColumns` strips SQL line + block comments before identifying column names so commented-out lines don't hide adjacent columns.
- `test/dream-verdict-cache-ttl.test.ts` — `dream_verdicts` TTL contract on PGLite: put assigns the default TTL, expired rows miss on read and only they are swept, re-judging via upsert refreshes a nearly-expired row, the migration backfill derives expiry from `judged_at` idempotently, and a NULL-expiry row (the pre-backfill upgrade window) reads as a hit and survives the sweep — the locally-runnable pin for the NULL-tolerant read predicate both engines share.
- `test/helpers/schema-diff.ts` + `test/helpers/schema-diff.test.ts` + `test/e2e/schema-drift.test.ts` — cross-engine schema parity gate. Helper exports pure `snapshotSchema(query)` / `diffSnapshots(pg, pglite, opts)` / `formatDiffForFailure(diff)` / `isCleanDiff(diff)` over a four-tuple per column (`data_type`, `udt_name`, `is_nullable`, `column_default`). E2E test spins up fresh PGLite + Postgres, runs `engine.initSchema()` on each, snapshots `information_schema.columns`, then diffs. 2-table allowlist (`files`, `file_migration_ledger`) — every other Postgres table must reach PGLite via `PGLITE_SCHEMA_SQL` or a migration's `sqlFor.pglite` branch. Sentinels for `oauth_clients`, `mcp_request_log`, `access_tokens`, `eval_candidates` give tighter blame messages. Skips without `DATABASE_URL`. Wired into `scripts/e2e-test-map.ts` so changes to `src/schema.sql`, `src/core/pglite-schema.ts`, or `src/core/migrate.ts` trigger it. The failure message names every drift with a paste-ready hint pointing at `src/core/pglite-schema.ts`.
- `test/setup-branching.test.ts` — setup flow.
- `test/slug-validation.test.ts` — slug validation.
- `test/storage.test.ts` — storage backends.
- `test/supabase-admin.test.ts` — Supabase admin.
- `test/yaml-lite.test.ts` — YAML parsing.
- `test/check-update.test.ts` — version check + update CLI.
- `test/pglite-engine.test.ts` — PGLite engine, all BrainEngine methods including `addLinksBatch` / `addTimelineEntriesBatch` (empty batch, missing optionals, within-batch dedup via ON CONFLICT, missing-slug rows dropped by JOIN, half-existing batch, batch of 100) plus `connect()` error-wrap assertion (original error nested, #223 link in message, lock released).
- `test/links-timeline-jsonb-poison.test.ts` — the PGLite half of the JSONB batch-poison lock (always-on, no `DATABASE_URL`). Locks the `jsonb_to_recordset` batch-insert path for links/timeline/takes against free-text "poison" payloads (commas, quotes, backslashes, braces, em-dashes) and asserts NUL is stripped from free-text body fields but rejected in identity fields. Lone-UTF-16-surrogate cases: every free-text field (link context; timeline summary/detail/source; take claim/source) well-forms to U+FFFD across batch + scalar write paths, while a surrogate in an identity field (slug) still fail-closed rejects the batch. The Postgres lane is `test/e2e/jsonb-batch-poison-postgres.test.ts`.
- `test/engine-factory.test.ts` — engine factory + dynamic imports.
- `test/integrations.test.ts` — recipe parsing, CLI routing, recipe validation.
- `test/publish.test.ts` — content stripping, encryption, password generation, HTML output.
- `test/backlinks.test.ts` — entity extraction, back-link detection, timeline entry generation.
- `test/lint.test.ts` — LLM artifact detection, code fence stripping, frontmatter validation.
- `test/report.test.ts` — report format, directory structure.
- `test/skills-conformance.test.ts` — skill frontmatter + required sections validation.
- `test/resolver.test.ts` — RESOLVER.md coverage, routing validation; round-trip that every quoted RESOLVER.md trigger matches a frontmatter `triggers:` entry in the target skill, and every `name="<word>"` reference in any SKILL.md resolves to a declared op in `src/core/operations.ts` or a Minions handler in `PROTECTED_JOB_NAMES`.
- `test/search.test.ts` — RRF normalization, compiled truth boost, cosine similarity, dedup key.
- `test/sql-ranking.test.ts` — source-boost helpers: longest-prefix-match in SQL CASE, `detail=high` temporal-bypass, three-meta-char LIKE escape (`%`, `_`, `\`), single-quote SQL-literal doubling, env override parsing for `GBRAIN_SOURCE_BOOST` + `GBRAIN_SEARCH_EXCLUDE`, `resolveBoostMap` / `resolveHardExcludes` merge semantics.
- `test/dedup.test.ts` — source-aware dedup, compiled truth guarantee, layer interactions.
- `test/query-intent-legacy.test.ts` — query intent classification: entity/temporal/event/general (the non-concept intents). `test/query-intent-concept.test.ts` — the `concept` intent: definitional/landscape cue detection, the proper-noun / quoted-phrase / sub-3-word guards, vector-lean weight routing.
- `test/eval.test.ts` — retrieval metrics: `precisionAtK`, `recallAtK`, `mrr`, `ndcgAtK`, `parseQrels`.
- `test/brainbench-fixtures.test.ts` / `test/brainbench-generator.test.ts` / `test/brainbench-metrics.test.ts` / `test/brainbench-continuity.test.ts` / `test/brainbench-writeback.test.ts` / `test/brainbench-adapters.test.ts` / `test/brainbench-scoreboard.test.ts` — the BrainBench memory-conformance unit suites (`src/eval/brainbench/`): fixture loader/validator + the sealed-gold seal (a `gold` key inside a fixture must reject) and committed-corpus integrity; generator determinism (the committed corpus is exactly what `gen.ts` produces, holdout discipline, category counts); metric formulas over hand-built turn rows (zero should-retrieve turns, empty injections, acceptable-vs-gold asymmetry, micro-averaging); cross-harness continuity (writer's decision persists through the production write-back pipeline, reader recalls on the SAME brain); write-back grading the PRODUCTION conversation→facts pipeline via the injected gold extractor; adapter seam contracts over hermetic PGLite (budget caps, suppression modes); scoreboard + gate governance (baseline determinism, count-aware gating, corpus-bless modes, justification flow, isolation gates-at-zero). `test/brainbench-floors.test.ts` — the pre-registered quality floors as executable assertions against the committed baseline (a baseline bless can't bank a threshold violation).
- `test/eval-brainbench-e2e.slow.test.ts` — BrainBench CLI end-to-end via subprocess against a small tmp corpus: the literal exit codes (0 pass / 1 regression / 2 error-or-inconclusive — the CI product), `--out` artifact validity incl. `_meta.metric_glossary`, byte-deterministic `--update-baseline`, anti-vacuous-pass, and the `eval run-all` once-per-sweep record. Slow-tiered with its own CI job (`slow-brainbench-e2e`); independent CLI runs execute once through a width-2 pool in `beforeAll`. There is no in-process full-corpus completion test: CI's `brainbench` gate runs the committed corpus fresh on every PR and its baseline compare is the fixtures-hash drift guard.
- `test/check-resolvable.test.ts` — resolver reachability, MECE overlap, gap detection, proximity-based DRY detection, `extractDelegationTargets` coverage.
- `test/dry-fix.test.ts` — auto-fix: three shape-aware expander pure-function tests; five guards (working-tree-dirty, no-git-backup, inside-code-fence, already-delegated within 40 lines, ambiguous-multi-match, block-is-callout).
- `test/doctor-fix.test.ts` — `gbrain doctor --fix` CLI integration: dry-run preview, apply path, JSON output shape.
- `test/backoff.test.ts` — load-aware throttling, concurrency limits, active hours.
- `test/fail-improve.test.ts` — deterministic/LLM cascade, JSONL logging, test generation, rotation.
- `test/transcription.test.ts` — provider detection, format validation, API key errors.
- `test/enrichment-service.test.ts` — entity slugification, extraction, tier escalation.
- `test/data-research.test.ts` — recipe validation, MRR/ARR extraction, dedup, tracker parsing, HTML stripping.
- `test/minions.test.ts` — Minions job queue: CRUD, state machine, backoff, stall detection, dependencies, worker lifecycle, lock management, claim mechanics, depth/child-cap, timeouts, cascade kill, idempotency, `child_done` inbox, attachments, removeOnComplete/Fail, `max_stalled` clamp/default/plumbing coverage.
- `test/minion-queue-renewlock-signal.test.ts` — `renewLock` forwards its optional AbortSignal to `executeRawDirect` (stub-engine capture); legacy 3-arg calls unchanged; token-fence miss returns false.
- `test/cycle-drain-renewal.test.ts` — `runDrainRenewalTick` (cycle drain): per-call signal aborted on timeout (slot released), onLost once on a lost fence, throws swallowed, hung renewal resolves at the deadline. Plus two structural source-text pins on `inline-drain.ts` (the shape guard only covers `worker.ts`): the renewal must not go back to a raw `setInterval(() => queue.renewLock(...))`, and the handler invocation must stay wrapped in `withChatPhase('job:<name>')` so a drained child's gateway spend is attributed to the child rather than absorbed by an enclosing `phase:` tag.
- `test/queue-probe-cancellation.test.ts` — `probeQueueState`/`queryWedgeSignals` signal threading: the 1500ms budget CANCELS the losing probe query; fast-path signals never abort; throw still collapses to `{probe_failed: true}`.
- `test/db-pool-max-lifetime.test.ts` — `resolveMaxLifetimeSeconds`: env forms, 0-disables, 30–60min jitter bounds, warn-once on invalid, per-call jitter variance.
- `test/pool-gauge.test.ts` — `CheckoutGauge` pure semantics + the PostgresEngine seams with fake pools: counted while in flight, released on resolve, on REJECTED queries, and on the SYNCHRONOUS pre-aborted-signal throw (leak guards); `getPoolDiagnostics` fail-open.
- `test/db-probe.test.ts` — `runDbProbe` verdict matrix (pool_starved / server_unreachable / unknown), honest-disjunction + no-waiter-arithmetic wording pins, hung probes cancelled via their signals, diagnostics absent/throwing fail open.
- `test/postgres-engine-reserved-routing.test.ts` — `withReservedConnection` routing: direct pool when dual-pool active, read pool when kill-switched/in-tx, semaphore cap (directPoolSize−1) with read-pool overflow, permit released on fn throw and reserve failure.
- `test/job-isolation-protocol.test.ts` — outcome-file codec round-trip + every decode failure path (missing/malformed/oversize→UnrecoverableError; byte counts, never content), handler-error instanceof reconstruction, child-CLI invocation resolution, and REAL detached-process `killProcessGroup` tests incl. the grandchild-death guarantee (exercises the Bun negative-pid `/bin/kill` fallback for real under `bun test`).
- `test/run-child-entry.test.ts` — `runChildJobEntry` on real in-memory PGLite with a REAL claim-minted token: success (fenced updateProgress lands), handler-failure outcome (exit 0), token-mismatch never runs the handler (exit 14), missing job/handler, parent-death watchdog aborts a live handler.
- `test/child-job-runner.test.ts` — `runJobInChild` against real .mjs children: success + full env contract (incl. `GBRAIN_DIRECT_POOL_SIZE=1`), error/lease outcome reconstruction, crash, SIGTERM-ignorer → group SIGKILL at the injected grace, pre-aborted signal, spawn ENOENT → `ChildSpawnInfraError`, worker-shutdown drain (report-during-drain completes; non-reporting kill → `ChildWorkerShutdownError`).
- `test/worker-job-isolation.test.ts` — full parent path on PGLite with the `fake-run-child.mjs` fixture: claim → child → fenced completeJob (real token over env), error outcome → failJob, crash burns the attempt, spawn failure RELEASES with zero attempts burned, and the serialization-parity pin (unreportable results fail in BOTH modes, never falsely complete).
- `test/jobs-isolation-flag.test.ts` — `parseJobIsolationFlag`: space/= forms, env fallback + flag-wins, empty-env default, other flags untouched.
- `test/extract.test.ts` — link extraction, timeline extraction, frontmatter parsing, directory type inference.
- `test/extract-db.test.ts` — `gbrain extract --source db`: typed link inference, idempotency, `--type` filter, `--dry-run` JSON output.
- `test/extract-fs.test.ts` — `gbrain extract --source fs`: first-run inserts + second-run reports zero, dry-run dedups candidates across files, second-run perf regression guard for the N+1 dedup bug.
- `test/link-extraction.test.ts` — canonical `extractEntityRefs` both formats, `extractPageLinks` dedup, `inferLinkType` heuristics, `parseTimelineEntries` date variants, `isAutoLinkEnabled` config.
- `test/graph-query.test.ts` — direction in/out/both, type filter, indented tree output.
- `test/features.test.ts` — feature scanning, brain_score calculation, CLI routing, persistence.
- `test/file-upload-security.test.ts` — symlink traversal, cwd confinement, slug + filename allowlists, remote vs local trust.
- `test/query-sanitization.test.ts` — prompt-injection stripping, output sanitization, structural boundary.
- `test/search-limit.test.ts` — `clampSearchLimit` default/cap behavior across `list_pages` and `get_ingest_log`.
- `test/repair-jsonb.test.ts` — JSONB repair: TARGETS list, idempotency, engine-awareness.
- `test/migrations-v0_12_2.test.ts` — JSONB-repair orchestrator phases: schema → repair → verify → record.
- `test/orphans.test.ts` — orphans command: detection, pseudo filtering, text/json/count outputs, MCP op.
- `test/postgres-engine.test.ts` — `statement_timeout` scoping: `sql.begin` + `SET LOCAL` shape, source-level grep guardrail against a reintroduced bare `SET statement_timeout`.
- `test/sync.test.ts` — sync logic + regression guard asserting top-level `engine.transaction` is not called.
- `test/sync-pull-failed-anchor.serial.test.ts` — a failed internal `git pull` (local-path origin vs `protocol.file.allow=never`) with zero imports returns `partial`/`pull_failed` (not `up_to_date`), freezes `last_commit` + `last_sync_at`, recovers after a manual pull; fall-through import of local commits preserved. Serial: pins `GBRAIN_HOME` to a temp dir for the whole file.
- `test/sync-concurrency.test.ts` — `autoConcurrency()` thresholds + PGLite-forces-serial + explicit-override clamping; `shouldRunParallel()` explicit-bypasses-floor contract; `parseWorkers()` validation rejecting `'0'`/`'-3'`/`'foo'`/`'1.5'`/trailing chars.
- `test/sync-parallel.test.ts` — PGLite-routed coverage of the bookmark gate under concurrency, head-drift gate, vanished-file failure capture, PGLite-stays-serial, and the `gbrain-sync` writer-lock contract.
- `test/sync-all-missing-path.test.ts` — `sync --all --missing-path <fail|skip>` pure helpers: `parseMissingPathMode` (default fail, explicit values, loud rejection of bad/dangling values, never swallows a following flag) and `partitionMissingPathSources` (classification driven only by the injected pathExists predicate — no fs; null `local_path` passes through runnable; order preserved).
- `test/sync-failures.test.ts` — `classifyErrorCode` regex coverage for all 12 codes against literal production message strings from `markdown.ts` and `import-file.ts`; `summarizeFailuresByCode` sort + pre-classified-honor; `recordSyncFailures` code-field persistence; `acknowledgeSyncFailures` `AcknowledgeResult` shape + backfill on legacy entries.
- `test/sync-soft-delete.serial.test.ts` — removed-file recovery arc: a `git rm` drained by sync SOFT-deletes the page (`deleted_at` set; row recoverable, not gone), an already-soft-deleted row isn't re-flipped (purge clock preserved), batch delete failures decompose to per-file batches and the run banks instead of aborting, delete → re-add inside the window revives via upsert (content updated, chunks replaced, no duplicate), soft-deleted pages stay invisible to search/getLinks/getBacklinks, the rename lane converges against an out-of-band soft delete, and full-sync reconcile + the unsyncable lane are SOFT with the purge window honored end-to-end.
- `test/sync-exclude-config.test.ts` — persisted `sync.exclude` reach: honored with no flag on incremental AND first-sync full-walk paths, trailing-slash covers directory contents, a per-call flag narrows without re-opening the persisted scope, mixed comma+newline multi-pattern values, conservative posture (pages imported before the exclusion stay live, incl. full-sync reconcile), and a throwing/unreadable config read degrades to no-persisted-scope instead of breaking the sync.
- `test/sync-include-hidden-config.test.ts` — persisted `sync.include_hidden` reach (the dot-directory waiver's twin to `sync.exclude`): baseline control (no config, no flag → dot-directory pruned), honored with no flag on incremental AND first-sync full-walk paths, trailing-slash covers nested files (lowercased slug), an unnamed dot-directory stays pruned, a per-call `includeHidden` unions with the persisted waiver, and a throwing config read degrades to no-waiver instead of breaking the sync.
- `test/doctor.test.ts` — doctor command; assertions that `jsonb_integrity` scans the four JSONB write sites and `markdown_body_completeness` is present.
- `test/utils.test.ts` — shared SQL utilities + `tryParseEmbedding` null-return and single-warn semantics.
- `test/build-llms.test.ts` — `llms.txt`/`llms-full.txt` generator: path resolution, idempotence, spec shape, regen-drift guard, content contract, AGENTS.md install-path mirror, size-budget enforcement.
- `test/oauth.test.ts` — OAuth 2.1 provider: register, getClient, `client_credentials` grant exchange, `authorization_code` flow with PKCE challenge/verifier, refresh token rotation, `verifyAccessToken` with both OAuth + legacy `access_tokens` fallback, `revokeToken`, `sweepExpiredTokens`; contract test asserting `scope` + `localOnly` annotations on all operations; `coerceTimestamp` unit cases (null/undefined/string/number/throw-on-NaN); NULL-`expires_at`-as-expired contract for both refresh + access token paths; cascade-delete contract asserting `revoke-client` purges `oauth_tokens` + `oauth_codes` via FK CASCADE; cross-client isolation (wrong-client attempt MUST reject AND rightful owner MUST still succeed atomically afterward); empty-string `redirect_uri` bypass guard; PKCE DCR public-client gate (`token_endpoint_auth_method: "none"` returns no `client_secret`, default `client_secret_post` clients get the one-time-reveal secret, `getClient` NULL→undefined normalization, full PKCE `/authorize` → `/token` round-trip against a public client).
- `test/mcp-dispatch-summarize.test.ts` — `summarizeMcpParams` invariants: declared-keys allow-list intersection, attacker-key-name leak guard (unknown keys counted not named), 1KB byte bucketing for size-probe defense, missing op falls through to fully-redacted shape, declared-keys sorted for deterministic output.
- `test/trust-boundary-contract.test.ts` — fail-closed trust semantics under cast bypass: `ctx.remote === undefined` treated as remote/untrusted at every flipped call site; `as any` and `Partial<>` spreads can't downgrade trust by accident.
- `test/remote-privacy-sweep.test.ts` — registry-driven remote privacy sweep: every non-localOnly op dispatched remote-shaped through `dispatchToolCall` against a corpus seeded with high-entropy private sentinels, in both scalar and federated caller shapes; the full response envelope (structured fields, rendered text, errors, `_meta.brain_hot_memory`) asserted sentinel-free. Fail-closed maintenance contract: a new op fails the suite until classified in `EXPECTED_OUTCOME` (+ `PARAM_FACTORY` if it can return corpus data); localOnly ops asserted denied over non-stdio transports; publish-gated ops must deny naming their gate. Curated static sibling: `test/operations-trust-boundary.test.ts`.
- `test/check-resolvable-cli.test.ts` — CLI wrapper: exit codes, JSON envelope shape, AGENTS.md fallback chain.
- `test/regression-v0_16_4.test.ts` — `findRepoRoot` regression guard, hermetic startDir parameterization.
- `test/repo-root.test.ts` — `findRepoRoot` walk semantics + default-arg parity; the 4-tier `autoDetectSkillsDir` fallback chain (`$OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE` → `~/.openclaw/workspace` → repo-root → `./skills`); RESOLVER.md/AGENTS.md filename precedence; explicit-env-wins-over-repo-root; tier-0 `$GBRAIN_SKILLS_DIR` valid/invalid/precedence-over-`OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE`; the install-path walk in `autoDetectSkillsDirReadOnly`; no-drift on primary success; `AUTO_DETECT_HINT` + `AUTO_DETECT_HINT_READ_ONLY` content; regression guard asserting the shared `autoDetectSkillsDir` MUST NEVER return `'install_path'` source (how the read-path/write-path split stays safe).
- `test/resolver-merge.test.ts` — multi-file resolver merge: `findAllResolverFiles` empty / RESOLVER.md-only / AGENTS.md-only / both-present (RESOLVER.md first); `checkResolvable` merge semantics across `skills/RESOLVER.md` + `../AGENTS.md` for the OpenClaw layout where the skillpack ships a thin RESOLVER.md and the real dispatcher lives at the workspace root; dedup by `skillPath` (first occurrence wins); AGENTS.md-at-workspace-root works alone.
- `test/filing-audit.test.ts` — filing audit: `writes_pages` / `writes_to` frontmatter, filing-rules JSON validation.
- `test/skill-brain-first.test.ts` — shared frontmatter parser; `analyzeSkillBrainFirst` compliance ladder across 9 fixtures under `test/fixtures/brain-first-skills/` (compliant-callout, compliant-phase, compliant-position, exempt-frontmatter, missing-brain-first, multi-pattern, negation-prose, no-external, typo-frontmatter); offset helpers; external-lookup regex shape; audit snapshot+diff transition logic; `FORMERLY_HARDCODED_EXEMPT` regression absorption.
- `test/routing-eval.test.ts` — fixture parsing, structural routing, `ambiguous_with`, Haiku tie-break layer.
- `test/skill-manifest.test.ts` — skill manifest parser: drift detection, managed-block markers.
- `test/skillify-scaffold.test.ts` — `gbrain skillify scaffold` stubs: SKILL.md, script, tests, routing-eval fixtures.
- `test/skillpack-install.test.ts` — skillpack bundle + surviving installer primitives: `bundle.ts` enumeration (manifest load/validate, dependency closure, `--all`) and the `installer.ts` seams that outlived the removed `skillpack install` command (`diffSkill` behind `gbrain skillpack diff`, managed-block build/parse, lockfile concurrency, atomic writes).
- `test/http-transport.test.ts` — HTTP transport: bearer auth + missing/no-Bearer/unknown/revoked + `/health` bypass; dispatch.ts round-trip; invalid_params; application/json response shape (not SSE); CORS default-deny + allowlist; body cap on Content-Length AND chunked; two-bucket rate limit (refill, exhaust+Retry-After, LRU eviction, TTL prune, pre-auth IP fires before DB); `mcp_request_log` audit on success + auth_failed.
- `test/mcp-expose.test.ts` — `gbrain mcp expose` against a fake Tailscale runner in a tmpdir: dispatch + argument shape (exclusive pairs, invalid `--port` / `--surface`), plan + consent (TTY prompt, non-TTY without `--yes`, declined), every Tailscale step (binary lookup and install plan, login including the refusal to `sudo` a non-system binary, the HTTPS-certificate / Funnel identity pre-checks, publish with the fail-closed `serve status` read and the foreign-handler refusal), happy paths on linux-systemd and darwin launchd (app-bundle CLI), service edge cases, `--status` and `--remove` including receipt-less recovery and the scoped `--set-path=/ off`, the occupied-port probe (any answer counts), the PGLite lock-holder warning, receipt shape guard + rollback + path confinement, engine detection + summary variants, and the `runMcp` dispatch regression; never prints a stack trace.
- `test/serve-service.test.ts` — the persistent-service half of `mcp expose`: paths under `gbrainPath('serve')` + supervisor target detection, `renderServeWrapper` (and the rendered wrapper actually running under bash), launchd plist + systemd unit renderers, `ensureAdminToken` (0600, token shape, exclusive-create race), install / uninstall / state probes with their edges and supervisor hardening, receipt read/write + shape validation.
- `test/tailscale.test.ts` — the pure Tailscale helpers: `parseTailscaleStatus` (tolerant of missing fields), `findTailscaleBinary`, `tailscaleInstallPlan` per platform, the argv builders, `parseServeStatusStrict` + handler lookup (non-JSON or non-object output is `null`, never an empty config), `classifyTailscaleError` kinds and defaults, and `defaultCommandRunner` via real spawns of hermetic commands only.
- `test/restart-sweep.test.ts` — `recipes/restart-sweep.md` inlined script: sentinel-anchored fenced-block extraction with salted tmp filenames to bypass ESM cache; constructor-time env reads (proves no module-load snapshot); idempotency layer load/save/atomic-tmp-rename/corrupt-JSON-recovery/30-day-prune; `(sessionKey, lastAlertedAt)` cooldown gate with 6h threshold; AGGRESSIVE-gate two-state tests; execFile argv shape proving shell metachars in `OPENCLAW_TELEGRAM_GROUP` cannot reach `/bin/sh`; real-`\n`-not-literal alert formatting; `GBRAIN_HOME` state path override.
- `test/eval-longmemeval.slow.test.ts` + `test/eval-longmemeval-e2e.slow.test.ts` — LongMemEval harness, hermetic with no `DATABASE_URL` and no API keys, split in two files so CI's LPT bin-packer can shard them: the pure / harness-shared half (harness lifecycle, PGLite create + `resetTables` over runtime-enumerated `pg_tables` with the infrastructure tables preserved, schema-migration robustness of the reset, the warm-create speed gate, `haystackToPages`, the source-boost regression guard, `loadResumeSet`, the schema-v2 `buildByTypeSummary`) and the end-to-end half (every describe that calls `runEvalLongMemEval` against ONE shared benchmark brain: stubbed-LLM answer-gen and `--retrieval-only` runs, JSONL format + key contract, per-question failure handling, `--resume-from`, `--by-type` + `--by-type-floor` on a no-op resume, a run where every question errored exits 1, duplicate `question_id` handling).
- `test/eval-longmemeval-mixedcase.slow.test.ts` — the like-for-like harness pinned on the `_s`-shaped mixed-case fixture (`test/fixtures/longmemeval-mixedcase.jsonl`, placeholder bodies under `scripts/check-fixture-privacy.sh`): raw-id join through the per-question slug→raw map, strict `recall_all` vs any-hit on a two-gold question, abstention exclusion, `slug_collision` error rows, `retrieval_config_hash`-gated resume, `retrieved[]` rows for replay.
- `test/eval-longmemeval-parse-args.test.ts` — hermetic table test for `gbrain eval longmemeval` argument validation: every invalid flag value exits 1 from `parseArgs` before any work (the dataset path is deliberately non-existent so a case that slipped past the parser fails with a DIFFERENT message), `--help` exits 0.
- `test/eval-longmemeval-cli-smoke.test.ts` — subprocess smoke through the real CLI, pre-dispatch flag validator included: the documented `--retrieval-only --by-type --no-trajectory --keyword-only` invocation exits 0 and writes a `by_type_summary` line (the flag registry once attributed these flags to another command's row).
- `test/generate-flag-registry.test.ts` — the flag-registry marker-segmentation rule: a `--flag` literal belongs to the command named in the enclosing `command === 'X'` head for every dispatch shape (plain, compound `&& args[0] === 'sub'`, multi-line compound).
- `test/longmemeval-judge.test.ts` + `test/eval-longmemeval-judge.slow.test.ts` — the judged answer-accuracy lane. Pure half: the `evaluate_qa.py::get_anscheck_prompt` port (one branch per question type, abstention by `_abs` suffix, the data-boundary framing + tag neutralisation), the official `'yes'`-substring verdict rule vs the runner's `malformed` class, `judge_config_hash` sensitivity, cost estimates, the `BudgetLedger`. End-to-end half: `--judge` on the mixed-case fixture with a canned reader (`ThinkLLMClient`) and a canned judge (`JudgeChatFn`) on in-memory PGLite — rows carry the judge fields + reader pins, the summary headline scores ungradable rows as incorrect, judge-only backfill on `--resume-from`.
- `test/longmemeval-metrics.test.ts` / `test/longmemeval-resume.test.ts` / `test/longmemeval-run-config.test.ts` / `test/longmemeval-emit.test.ts` / `test/longmemeval-capture.test.ts` / `test/longmemeval-reader.test.ts` / `test/longmemeval-splits-fixture.test.ts` — pure pins for the harness modules: the raw-id join + `recall_all@k` / `recall_any@k` + schema-v2 buckets; resume re-scoring (recall recomputed, never trusted; `gold_missing` / `collisions` counted over the same row set as a live run); `loadQuestionIds` / `loadDataset` and the `retrieval_config_hash` `--search-pin` fold (an absent fold hashes identically to every existing receipt); the emitter's truncate / append modes, atomic summary rewrite and same-file resume compaction; the `--capture-pool` receipt fields mirroring hybrid.ts's autocut inputs; the reader receiving WHOLE sessions (the 4000-char sanitizer cap does not apply); integrity of the committed seed-42 splits (ids only, disjoint halves, no `_abs` ids).
- `test/longmemeval-embed-cache.test.ts` — `src/eval/shared/embed-cache.ts` hermetic pins (counting fake transport, `bun:sqlite` files under a per-test tmp dir, an explicit `openai:text-embedding-3-large @ 4 dims` gateway): exact `(model@dims, text, side)` keying, the hard `EmbedCacheIntegrityError` on a dims mismatch, `bypassed` / `infra_faults` accounting, the canonical hash. Its canonical-hash describe is listed in `scripts/structural-suites.tsv`.
- `test/longmemeval-diagnostics.test.ts` — miss diagnostics (`src/eval/longmemeval/diagnostics.ts`) pure pins: the class decision table (synthetic arm ranks → class), the frozen clause splitter, the H1 signature and H3a/H3b split, receipt parsing + top-k reading, split membership, the summary and glossary header.
- `test/replay-autocut-floor.test.ts` — `src/eval/shared/autocut-replay.ts` + its CLI on synthetic pools: the live decisions the shipped default (jump 0.2, minKeep 1, floor 0.35) makes on the fixture pools are HARDCODED literals worked by hand (so `validateLive` is checked against something the code did not produce), the floor sweep, paired deltas, split-half, `normalizePoolRow` refusing slug-less rows.
- `test/eval-spend-guard.test.ts` — `scripts/eval-spend-guard.sh` subprocess pins with a temp ledger (env passed to spawn, never mutated): a marker file proves the wrapped command ran; two rows per launch (`running` reservation, `done` reconciliation); fail-closed on a missing / unparseable ledger, a malformed amount and a cap breach; actual-cost file precedence.
- `test/r1-namedthing-rerank-ab.test.ts` — `scripts/r1-namedthing-rerank-ab.ts` + the NamedThingBench corpus module, hermetic: the embed transport is stubbed to throw so only the OFF arm runs in-process; the ON arm's paid path is covered by the pure verdict / integrity functions and the CLI dry run's "ON arm skipped" contract; the seed-contract engine lives in `beforeAll` (test-isolation rule R3).
- `test/ai/gateway-chat-temperature.test.ts` — `ChatOpts.temperature` reaches the AI SDK call and the provider-reported snapshot surfaces as `ChatResult.responseModel` (the judge pins temperature 0; without the field a judge run would have used the provider default), through the `__setGenerateTextTransportForTests` seam.
- `test/search/fusion-lists.test.ts` + `test/search/expansion-variant-budget.test.ts` — role-tagged fusion arms + budget-normalized weighted RRF: pure pins for `composeFusionLists` / `rrfFusionWeighted` (`null` budget is byte-identical to unweighted fusion; empty arms cast no vote; a missing original makes every text arm a variant), then `search.expansion_variant_budget` end-to-end through `hybridSearch` on a discriminating corpus (in-memory PGLite + deterministic `basisEmbedding`), delta-asserted.
- `test/search/arm-confidence.test.ts` + `test/search/arm-confidence-hybrid.test.ts` — `search.keyword_arm_confidence_floor`: the pure statistic + decision, its composition through `fusion-lists.ts`, the knob plane (bundle, config parse, resolution chain, knobs-hash `kacf=`, registry), and the hermetic end-to-end where a weak keyword arm is down-weighted only with the floor set.
- `test/search/metadata-boost-gate.test.ts` + `test/search/metadata-boost-gate-hybrid.test.ts` — `search.metadata_boost_gate`: `lexicalArmsVoted` / `decideMetadataBoosts` (relaxed rows never count; image modality exempt), the thread through `runPostFusionStages`, the knob plane (`mbg=`, dashboard), and the hermetic end-to-end in which a hub page's backlink / recency boosts are skipped when only the vector arm voted.
- `test/search/relational-rerank-pin.test.ts` + `test/search/relational-rerank-pin-hybrid.serial.test.ts` — `search.relational_rerank_pin`: pure permutation pins for `pinRelationalRows` (top block in fused order bounded by `max`; a row the reranker ranked higher keeps that claim; one row per page; text rows keep relative order; every no-op path returns the input) and the ONE range contract, then the end-to-end on the relational corpus (bodies never name the related entity) with a canned reranker on in-memory PGLite — serial lane because it mocks the reranker module.
- `test/search/relational-intent-memo.test.ts` — the default relational pattern set is compiled once per process (identity across calls, stateless sharing).
- `test/config-adaptive-return-keys.test.ts` — the adaptive-return / autocut / CRAG search knobs AND the four ranker-wave keys (`search.expansion_variant_budget`, `search.relational_rerank_pin`, `search.keyword_arm_confidence_floor`, `search.metadata_boost_gate`) are registered in `KNOWN_CONFIG_KEYS`, so `gbrain config set` on a documented knob is never a silent no-op.
- `test/longmemeval-sanitize.test.ts` — sanitization parity pinning that `INJECTION_PATTERNS` from `src/core/think/sanitize.ts` is the single source of truth (adding a pattern there must cover both `<take>` framing and `<chat_session>` framing, no per-surface regex drift).
- `test/openai-compat-multimodal.test.ts` — gateway's openai-compatible multimodal path: happy-path single + multi-input embedding, unauthenticated proxy mode, dimension-mismatch guard (throws `AIConfigError` with model id + observed + expected pre-storage), default-dim fallback when recipe declares `default_dims`, HTTP 401 / 400 / malformed-JSON / non-array error paths, and the Voyage `/multimodalembeddings` recipe still routing through its dedicated path. Hermetic via the `__setEmbedTransportForTests` seam.
- `test/serve-stdio-lifecycle.test.ts` — `MCP_STDIO=1` env guard: stdin EOF does NOT trigger shutdown when the env is set, SIGTERM still does (guard scope is correct), unset env preserves the CLI lifecycle. Exercises the `ServeOptions.mcpStdio?: boolean` test seam directly so tests don't mutate `process.env`.
- `test/db-lock-fencing.test.ts` — fenced lock identity: a `DbLockHandle` carries its acquisition fence, `refresh()` returns true while owned and false after a steal (0-row fenced UPDATE), a stolen-from handle's `release()` is a fenced no-op that leaves the successor's row intact, and `startCycleLockRefresher` aborts its controller with `LockStolenError` on a fenced miss while serializing ticks (a slow refresh never overlaps the next).
- `test/cycle-lock-steal.serial.test.ts` — runCycle steal-abort arc end-to-end: a mid-run steal produces a structured partial report (`reason: 'lock_stolen'`), runs no further phases, and never touches the successor's lock row; a steal-free cycle completes and releases normally.
- `test/cycle-any-abort-signal.test.ts` — `anyAbortSignal` combining: pre-aborted inputs, late aborts propagating their reason, duck-typed signal stubs (no `addEventListener`) observed via poll, and `dispose()` detaching the caller-signal listener + clearing the poll timer (the daemon leak class).
- `test/cycle-triage-rescue.test.ts` — the dream triage gate: `passesTriageGate` band arithmetic (floor inclusive, at/above threshold never "rescued"), content-type allowlisting, segment verification through `normForGrounding` (case/curly-quote/dash folding matches, fabricated segments never do), the ≥40-char + dedupe-by-normalized-quote rules, and fail-closed behavior on every malformed verdict shape (null score, missing/short/non-string segments) with `minSegments: 0` as the kill switch.
- `test/cycle-synthesize-verify.test.ts` — the mechanical quote verify/repair pass: span extraction with code fences / inline code / wikilinks / link targets masked, odd-mark paragraphs counted `unbalanced`, the repair ladder (exact keep → normalized replace with the verbatim slice → near-match replace → strip the marks keeping the text, never fabricate), the offset-map invariant that every replacement is a real transcript slice, ambiguity fall-through, `skipped_preexisting` scoping by content-hash slug suffix, warn-only numeric/date claim counting, write-back through `importFromContent` only when a span changed, and per-page fail-open.
- `test/cycle-write-path-mini-eval.test.ts` — the hermetic **$0** write-path mini-eval. A frozen 3-transcript mini-corpus (high / buried / routine bands, placeholder names, deliberately disjoint from the paid Cat 35 corpus so there is no tuning coupling) drives the REAL `runPhaseSynthesize` on PGLite: real triage parse + gate incl. the rescue, real fan-out + oneshot drain, real quote verify/repair, real provenance stamp + reverse-write + telemetry. The ONLY stub is the gateway chat transport (`__setChatTransportForTests`), serving a scripted judge and a scripted child. Scope honesty matters here: a scripted child CANNOT measure whether a prompt change improved model output — that stays the paid benchmark's job (receipts in `docs/eval/FIX_WAVE_BASELINES.md`). This is the no-API-key regression pin for the MECHANICAL write path, and its salient-unit presence score is the canary that catches emission, chunk-slug-rewrite, and repair-over-deletion regressions in the normal unit lane.
- `test/cycle-synthesize-triage.test.ts` / `test/cycle-synthesize-triage-calibration.test.ts` — triage gate wiring inside `runTriagePass` (reports carry `rescued`/`verified_segments`, `details.triage` rescue + token counters, dry-run parity), plus the 25-fixture calibration corpus (10 high / 10 low / 5 buried, all synthetic placeholders) enforcing band-consistent parsing, a ≥80% band-accuracy rubric-drift pin, and that ≥4 of the 5 buried fixtures reach the gate. `TRIAGE_VERSION` participates in cache validity, so a rubric bump re-judges rather than serving stale verdicts.
- `test/dream-retriage.test.ts` — `gbrain dream retriage` reads THE shared gate: reconcile-queue never cancels a rescued job, `--audit-rejects` excludes rescued files from the reject sample, alongside the spend-gate / dry-run / liveness arcs.
- `test/facts-extract-idea-kind.test.ts` — the `idea` extractor kind: taxonomy coercion (known kinds survive verbatim, `idea` stays `idea`, unknown kinds coerce to `fact`), prompt shape (the two precomputed system-prompt variants differ in EXACTLY one clause — the low-tier line — both carry the idea definition and the widened enum, and repeat calls return the identical string so prompt caching still hits), and admission wiring (no admission or an admission allowing `low` → label-honestly; a high-only admission → skip-low).
- `test/migrations-v145.test.ts` — the `facts.kind` CHECK widening: the migration's structure (canonical name, idempotent flag, probe + widened predicate), a fresh PGLite schema admitting an `idea` INSERT, and an upgrade from a pre-v145 brain swapping the 5-kind constraint for the widened one with a re-run applying nothing.
- `test/queue-stall-parent-unblock.test.ts` — the shared `killJobs` tail: a stall-exhausted child lands `child_done(dead)` in its parent's inbox and unblocks the parent, a requeued child doesn't touch the parent, all three reapers route through the tail with their own outcome, and the idempotent stranded-parent sweep self-heals parents whose children were already dead (without unblocking parents that still have a live child).
- `test/queue-started-at-retry.test.ts` — every automatic re-run path clears `started_at` (failJob delayed branch, stall requeue, lease release, promoteDelayed, parent re-claim) so a retried job's wall-clock budget measures execution, not backoff wait; end-to-end survival of the wall-clock sweep on a fresh attempt.
- `test/embed-modality-preserved.test.ts` — `carryChunkMetadata` carries modality + all code-metadata fields through re-embed merges (an image chunk stays image), plus the write-side contract that omitting modality resets it to text (why the shared list is load-bearing).
- `test/embed-oversize-heal.test.ts` — oversize-chunk healing pure core: `healOversizedChunks` split/reindex/metadata-carry (fenced_code `chunk_source` never coerced), `healedChunksToStaleRows` remap (only rows still needing embeddings survive), and the `healOversizedPageChunks` orchestrator incl. the freshness guard (a concurrent rewrite between snapshot and write skips the heal — no clobber).
- `test/embed-oversize-heal-drain.serial.test.ts` — the heal wired into all three real drains against PGLite: `embedStaleForSource`, `embedStalePages` (phase-end closure), and `runEmbedCore --stale` (embedAllStale) heal oversized stored rows in place while preserving the embedded sibling's vector.
- `test/embed-stall.test.ts` — the embed stall watchdog unit: `resolveEmbedStallAbortSeconds` env resolution (default 900; garbage → default; `<= 0` disables), `createEmbedStallWatchdog` fire/reset/stop semantics, the run-scoped embedding-API liveness clock, and the `assertEmbedNotStalled` handler contract (clean result no-op, stalled result throws).
- `test/jobs-embed-stall-wiring.serial.test.ts` — the stall contract at the minion boundary: an embed job whose core result carries `reason: 'stall_timeout'` THROWS (job marked failed, banked progress in the message); a clean result resolves with the embed report.
- `test/embed.serial.test.ts` — `runEmbedCore` lifecycle on PGLite with `mock.module` seams: abort-signal threading, the stall-watchdog arc against the real lock table (stall fires → single-flight locks released + summary flushed + `reason: 'stall_timeout'` surfaces; non-CLI callers get the error RESULT, no process exit; live progress keeps the watchdog quiet), cleanup aborting an in-flight heartbeat refresh, and the heartbeat tick-timeout arc (a never-settling refresh times out per tick via `GBRAIN_EMBED_LOCK_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MS`; 3 consecutive failures → `lock_lost` + drain abort).
- `test/handlers-embed-backfill.test.ts` — the `embed-backfill` job handler's budget-cap classification matrix: default cap dropped for unpriced models, `pricing.overrides` restores enforceability, `off` uncaps, explicit caps fail closed on unpriced models (incl. an explicit $10 equal to the default), the defaulted cap still enforces for priced models, a present-but-garbage cap value keeps the $10 default FAIL-CLOSED (never droppable), and the handler-lane stall watchdog (a wedged drain aborts and fails the job).
- `test/ai/reranker-readiness.test.ts` — the pure `rerankerReadiness` predicate: the default Voyage model with and without the key (the fix names the key AND the disable command; an empty-string key counts as absent), shape failures that never throw (unknown provider, no reranker touchpoint, unlisted model, keyless local recipe, garbage input), and agreement with `gateway.isAvailable('reranker', model)` on an env × model matrix.
- `test/rerank-no-key.serial.test.ts` — the gateway `no_key` preflight: `RerankError('no_key')` before any HTTP call, ONE audit row per process per model with no stderr line, the per-model memo and its test seam, no budget reservation for a skipped rerank (and `BudgetExhausted` before the transport call when the key IS present), HTTP 401 staying `auth`; plus `applyReranker` on `no_key` — results unchanged, no per-query rows, `onSkip` fires, a throwing hook never breaks search, and genuine failures never fire it.
- `test/hybrid-reranker-skipped.serial.test.ts` — balanced search on PGLite without `VOYAGE_API_KEY`: `reranker_skipped (no_key)` stamped on the meta with results kept and nothing printed, fresh searches retain the stamp while shared result caching stays disabled with no cache writes even when requested, and with the key present the reranker runs (`rerank_score` stamped, no skip entry).
- `test/degraded-stages-recall.test.ts` — `affectsRecall` / `RANKING_ONLY_DEGRADED_STAGES`: `reranker_skipped` is ranking-only, every other closed-vocabulary stage affects recall, and a mixed list is degraded iff a recall-affecting stage is present.
- `test/cli-explain-degraded-render.test.ts` — `formatResult --explain` threads the captured retrieval meta: a `reranker_skipped` stamp renders as the degraded header, a clean run prints no header, and the plain (non-explain) renderer is unchanged.
- `test/doctor-reranker-health.test.ts` — the readiness-aware `reranker_health` check: key absent → warn naming the key and the disable command; key present → ok "ready"; disabled by config row or by the conservative bundle → ok; `no_key` skip rows informational once ready; a DB-plane key the CLI folded into the gateway counts; the no-gateway fallback to env > file > DB plane; unknown model, self-host override and `auth` rows; a brain with no embedding provider is never blamed; audit rows for another model never warn on the active default.
- `test/modes-report-reranker.test.ts` — `buildModesReport` attributes the five reranker knobs, the readiness block flips on the key, config overrides are reflected; `formatModesText` prints the runtime `Reranker:` line plus the per-bundle `reranker=… autocut=…` line and surfaces a gateway base-URL override as `self_hosted`; `redactReadinessForRemote` strips `required_key` / `key_present` / `fix` and keeps the verdict.
- `test/init-reranker-default.test.ts` — `writeNewInstallRerankerDefault`: a Voyage key present → no write regardless of embedding pick; a keyed non-Voyage pick without the key → explicit `search.reranker.enabled=false`; a keyless install → no write; a Voyage key that lives only in the DB config plane or only in `config.json` counts; never-clobber on an existing explicit row.
- `test/import-abort-error.test.ts` — `runImport` preflight/argv failures throw typed `ImportAbortError` instead of exiting the process; the calling process survives the abort.
- `test/lint-fix-single-pass.test.ts` — `gbrain lint --fix` walks the tree once and `total_fixed` reports the fixes THIS run applied.
- `test/snapshot-shape-guard.test.ts` — PGLite snapshot loader refusal matrix: shape-less version files, dims/model mismatches, and stale schema hashes are all refused; matching hash + shape loads; a migration-handler edit changes the hash.
- `test/stats-health-source-scope.test.ts` — source-scoped stats/health/identity: engine-level scoping (every counter confined; degrees/denominators/the islanded predicate scope BOTH edge endpoints; mutating an excluded source moves nothing a scoped caller sees) plus the op layer (remote scalar + federated grants confine `get_stats`/`get_health`/`get_brain_identity`; remote unscoped and the `__all__` sentinel fail closed to zeros; trusted local keeps the brain-wide view).
- `test/takes-list-subcommand.test.ts` — `takes list` routing (`list` is a subcommand, not a slug) + the `--limit`/`--offset` flags: cap/skip/paging, engine default without `--limit`, bare `list` unchanged, and invalid values (`0`, non-numeric) exit 1 with the positive-integer message.
- `test/stale-takes-bigint.test.ts` + `test/take-proposals.test.ts` — 64-bit row normalization at the engine boundary: `listStaleTakes` rows and `takes propose --json` / `loadProposal` rows come back as NUMBERS (never bigint/string ids or string weights) on both engines, so takes embed/propose survive real Postgres int8 rows.
- `test/llm-json-reasoning-ladder.test.ts` — `parseLlmJson`'s reasoning-block recovery ladder: strips a closed or truncated `<think>` block ONLY after a raw parse fails (valid JSON containing the tag text is untouched), case-insensitive, array payloads, and the facts/atoms extractors routing through it (the ORIGINAL failure reason is preserved when the retry also fails).
- `test/models-per-task-extract-atoms.serial.test.ts` — `gbrain models` reports `models.dream.extract_atoms` through the phase's own resolver (pins the narrow-resolver divergence: `models.tier.utility` is deliberately ignored; unconfigured falls back to the same tier default the runtime uses).
- `test/conversation-facts-pricing-wiring.test.ts` — `pricing.overrides` reaches every conversation-facts entry point: the strict config registry accepts the key, and direct extraction, the cycle backfill, and `transcripts --facts` all price through the operator override.
- `test/cycle/extract-atoms-model-config-fail-soft.test.ts` — a throwing `getConfig` during extract_atoms model resolution falls back to the tier default instead of rejecting the phase.

### E2E test inventory

E2E tests live in `test/e2e/` and run against real Postgres+pgvector (require `DATABASE_URL`), except where noted as PGLite in-memory (no `DATABASE_URL` needed). One file outside the directory also rides the e2e lane: `test/phantom-redirect-engine-parity.test.ts` (Postgres arm; see the file taxonomy above).

- `test/e2e/facts-separation-postgres.test.ts` — real-Postgres parity for cross-session facts, supersession, and the pre-limit `unconsolidatedOnly` predicate used by consolidation.

- `bun run test:e2e` runs Tier 1 (mechanical, all operations, no API keys). Includes dedicated cases for the postgres-engine `addLinksBatch` / `addTimelineEntriesBatch` bind path — postgres-js's JSONB bind (`jsonb_to_recordset(($1::jsonb)->'rows')`) differs from PGLite's and gets its own coverage.
- `test/e2e/search-quality.test.ts` — search quality against PGLite (no API keys, in-memory).
- `test/e2e/graph-quality.test.ts` — knowledge graph pipeline (auto-link via put_page, reconciliation, traversePaths) against PGLite in-memory.
- `test/e2e/jsonb-batch-poison-postgres.test.ts` — the real-Postgres half of the JSONB batch-poison lock (the engine whose bind path differs). Seeds free-text "poison" context (Zoom URL with `?pwd=`, commas, quotes, Windows backslash path, braces, em-dash) and asserts the links/timeline/takes batch writers do not error with "malformed array literal"; also asserts NUL is stripped from free-text bodies (`context`/`summary`/`detail`/`claim`) and still rejected in identity fields. Lone-surrogate lock: a lone UTF-16 surrogate in free text (the `22P02` class on Supabase) well-forms to U+FFFD across batch + scalar paths (incl. timeline + take `source`), while a surrogate in an identity field still rejects the batch. `DATABASE_URL`-gated.
- `test/e2e/postgres-jsonb.test.ts` — round-trips all 5 JSONB write sites (`pages.frontmatter`, `raw_data.data`, `ingest_log.pages_updated`, `files.metadata`, `page_versions.frontmatter`) against real Postgres and asserts `jsonb_typeof='object'` plus `->>'key'` returns the expected scalar. Guards against the double-encode bug.
- `test/e2e/integrity-batch.test.ts` — parity for `scanIntegrity`'s batch-load fast path vs sequential. Cases (dedup, hits, validate, topPages) seed a fixture and assert both paths return identical results. Dedup case uses raw SQL via `getConn().unsafe()` to seed a `(test-source-2, people/alice)` row alongside the default-source row, since `engine.putPage` doesn't take a `source_id`. Pins multi-source overcounting; the "multi-source duplicate slugs scan once" case expects both batch + sequential paths to report 2.
- `test/e2e/jsonb-roundtrip.test.ts` — companion regression against the 4 doctor-scanned JSONB sites. Assertion-level overlap with `postgres-jsonb.test.ts` is intentional defense-in-depth: if doctor's scan surface drifts from the actual write surface, one of these tests catches it.
- `test/e2e/sync.test.ts` — `--skip-failed` failure-loop test alongside happy-path tests: broken file → `performSync` returns `blocked_by_failures` with grouped breakdown → `performSync({skipFailed: true})` advances bookmark and returns `AcknowledgeResult` with code summary → second broken file → second cycle. Saves and restores the user's real `~/.gbrain/sync-failures.jsonl` so the test is hermetic. Asserts bookmark gating, JSONL state, dedup across paths, summary aggregation, and the literal doctor-rendering string format.
- `test/e2e/upgrade.test.ts` — check-update against real GitHub API (network required).
- `test/e2e/minions-shell-pglite.test.ts` — PGLite `--follow` inline shell-job path (in-memory, no `DATABASE_URL` required) — the path the minion-orchestrator skill documents for dev use.
- `test/e2e/job-isolation.test.ts` — process isolation on real Postgres (DATABASE_URL-gated, wired EXPLICITLY into `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` tier1 — the workflow runs only named files): a concurrency-3 isolated drain through real child processes (the `fake-run-child.mjs` fixture — real spawns, no child DB pools), and the REAL `jobs run-child` CLI entrypoint end-to-end (engine bootstrap incl. the child's own pools, quiet handler registry, token validation, outcome protocol).
- `test/e2e/sync-reconcile-postgres.test.ts` — the sync reconcile's real-Postgres array-parameter binding path (`DATABASE_URL`-gated). Wired EXPLICITLY into `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` tier1 beside job-isolation, and listed in the selected-e2e EXCLUDE set so a PR touching sync.ts doesn't run it a second time there.
- `test/e2e/pglite-cli-exit.serial.test.ts` — real spawned-CLI exit behavior on PGLite (in-memory, no `DATABASE_URL`): read commands (`search`/`get`/`query`) exit 0 promptly; CLI_ONLY `capture` exits clean and frees the single-writer lock; the teardown describes pin every disconnect site — a failed op exits 1 with the error on stderr, and the dashboard, read-only-timeout, doctor, and `dream --dry-run` paths all exit with no force-exit banner.
- `test/e2e/pgbouncer-teardown.test.ts` — PgBouncer TRANSACTION-mode teardown. Pins the bug CLASS, not timings: a CLI op against a txn-mode pooled URL exits 0 with intact stdout and does NOT ride the 10s hard-deadline backstop (the `engine.disconnect() did not return` banner is the smoking gun). Gated by `GBRAIN_PGBOUNCER_URL` + `GBRAIN_PGBOUNCER_DIRECT_URL` (NOT `DATABASE_URL`) — set automatically by `bun run ci:local`'s `pgbouncer` compose service. Both URLs survive the E2E runner and preload scrub, while CLI children clear ordinary database overrides so the pooled URL in their isolated config wins. Selected CI runs require a nonzero executed-test count (`GBRAIN_CI_REQUIRE_PGBOUNCER=1`); missing targets or an all-skipped file fail the gate. It skips gracefully elsewhere. Uses a DEDICATED `gbrain_pgbouncer_test` database so it never races the `gbrain_test` TRUNCATE fixtures.
- `test/e2e/volunteer-context-postgres.test.ts` — `volunteer_context` on REAL Postgres (engine parity beyond the hermetic PGLite unit suite): resolution arms through the actual op handler, the fire-and-forget volunteer-event sink landing rows, the stats join, and the RLS pin that `context_volunteer_events` has ROW LEVEL SECURITY enabled (keeps the v35 auto-RLS event trigger honest for migration-created tables). `DATABASE_URL`-gated.
- `test/e2e/openclaw-reference-compat.test.ts` — `check-resolvable` + skillpack install-model against a minimal AGENTS.md workspace fixture (`test/fixtures/openclaw-reference-minimal/`), regression guard for the OpenClaw deployment shape.
- `test/e2e/workspace-generic-compat.test.ts` — always-on (PGLite, no binary): pins the INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md "any repo with a workspace" contract against `test/fixtures/generic-agents-workspace/` (Hermes is the motivating consumer): `cwd_walk_up` detection, the `GBRAIN_SKILLS_DIR` override, `check-resolvable` on a root AGENTS.md, and scaffold additivity + refuse-overwrite. The real Hermes-behavior proof is the door suite below.
- `test/e2e/install-real-hermes.serial.test.ts` — the hermes "door": real `hermes` binary + real `hermes mcp add` handshake (full-catalog tool discovery; the count tracks the op catalog, so the test asserts discovery happened, not a number) + a paid `hermes -z` recall turn against a seeded brain. Triple-gated: `GBRAIN_REAL_HERMES_E2E=1` (explicit opt-in — run-e2e.sh scrubs GBRAIN_*, so it can never fire under `bun run test:e2e`) + resolvable binary + non-empty ANTHROPIC key (anthropic-pinned on purpose: a second provider key flips hermes provider-auto into a mis-routed 401). Hermetic HOME + HERMES_HOME with a tripwire on the operator's real config; evidence copies to `GBRAIN_E2E_EVIDENCE_DIR` for CI upload. Venue: heavy-tests.yml (`real-agent-e2e` + `hermes-door` jobs).
- `test/e2e/install-real-grok.serial.test.ts` — the grok "door" (xAI Grok Build; every asserted shape observed against the pin in `docs/mcp/GROK-CLI-PIN.md`). SPLIT-GATED, a deliberate divergence from the hermes door: grok's `mcp add/list/doctor` run keyless, so the compat tier (version-shape pin, documented-shape `grok mcp add gbrain -- gbrain serve --surface verbs` via a PATH-staged bin dir, saved-TOML asserts via `Bun.TOML.parse`, `mcp doctor` handshake proving the seven-verb surface, vendor-fallback provenance guard, direct-TOML surface) needs only `GBRAIN_REAL_GROK_E2E=1` + a resolvable binary; the paid SMOKE additionally needs a non-empty `XAI_API_KEY` and asserts a PER-RUN NONCE fact (grok has fs/shell tools — the committed fact is greppable, so recall of it proves nothing) with web search disabled. `mcp add` is lazy (exit 0 always) — `mcp doctor <name> --json` is the honest discriminator (exit 0/1 observed). Hermetic HOME + GROK_HOME + tmp cwd on every spawn (grok reads vendor MCP configs for trusted folders and loads `.envrc` from cwd); bounded tripwire over the operator's real `~/.grok` config/credential files (volatile paths excluded — grok rewrites logs/sessions/bin/docs every run) + a checkout guard that no `.grok/`/`.mcp.json` appeared in the repo root. Venue: heavy-tests.yml (`real-agent-e2e` + `grok-door` jobs); run directly via `GBRAIN_REAL_GROK_E2E=1 bun test test/e2e/install-real-grok.serial.test.ts`.
- `test/e2e/install-real-opencode.serial.test.ts` — the opencode "door" (SST opencode; every asserted shape observed against the pin in `docs/mcp/OPENCODE-CLI-PIN.md`). SPLIT-GATED a step past the grok door: opencode's anonymous FREE TIER drives MCP tool calls keyless, so even the nonce SMOKE runs in the keyless tier — T1 bare-semver version pin (the SST-vs-claimant discriminator), T2 documented-shape `opencode mcp add gbrain --env … -- gbrain serve --surface verbs` + the honest `opencode mcp list` discriminator (it SPAWNS every server; `✓/✗` text is the assertion surface — exit code is 0 even on failure, and `mcp debug` is OAuth-only), T2b spawn-gate CANARY (a project-config decoy is spawn-attempted with NO trust prompt — if this ever gates, the bootstrap user-global scope default's rationale changed: re-observe), T3 writer parity (gbrain's `opencode-json.ts` output handshakes through the real binary; cross-tool preservation both ways), T4 keyless SMOKE (per-run nonce + STRUCTURAL `gbrain_*` tool_use proof via `parseOpencodeJsonl`, `--format json`). The paid T5 anthropic leg additionally needs a non-empty `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and self-validates the pinned model id against the authed `opencode models` list BEFORE any spend. Hermetic HOME + both XDG dirs + tmp cwd on every spawn; `--pure` on every probe (`mcp list` autoloads plugins — a code-execution surface); bounded tripwire over the operator's real opencode configs/auth.json + a repo-root checkout guard. Venue: heavy-tests.yml (`real-agent-e2e` + `opencode-door` jobs, plus the schedule-only `opencode-door-canary` latest-version leg — continue-on-error, a pin-refresh signal, never a gate); run directly via `GBRAIN_REAL_OPENCODE_E2E=1 bun test test/e2e/install-real-opencode.serial.test.ts`.

**Door cadence policy:** the NEWEST door agent runs at nightly/schedule cadence (currently opencode, whose canary leg also tracks `latest`); a door drops to label-only (`real-agent-e2e`) after 2 stable monthly cycles with unchanged pins. Rationale: churn concentrates in the newest integration; steady-state doors pay for themselves on demand, not nightly.
- `test/helpers/tty-harness.ts` + `test/tty-harness.test.ts` — the DX real-PTY harness (`Bun.spawn({terminal:})`): pure text/timing helpers unit-tested with zero subprocesses, plus three live PTY smokes against `sh` guarded by `describe.skipIf(!ptySupported())`. The harness itself is a dev instrument surface — its consumer `scripts/dx-explore.ts` never runs in CI (transcripts land in gitignored `.context/dx-runs/`); see `docs/guides/bootstrap.md` for the scenario runbook.
- `test/e2e/search-swamp.test.ts` — reproduces the source-swamp case. Seeds a curated `originals/talks/article-outline-fat-code` page against two `<fork>/chat/` pages stuffed with the same multi-word phrase. Asserts the article wins keyword AND vector ranking, that `detail=high` lets the chat swamp re-surface, and that `source_id` passes through the two-stage CTE intact. PGLite in-memory.
- `test/e2e/search-exclude.test.ts` — `test/` + `archive/` pages hidden by default, `include_slug_prefixes` opts back in, caller-supplied `exclude_slug_prefixes` adds to defaults. Both keyword and vector search paths.
- `test/e2e/engine-parity.test.ts` — Postgres ↔ PGLite top-result and result-set parity for `searchKeyword` + `searchVector` (Postgres ranks pages then picks best chunk while PGLite returns chunks directly, so the source-boost behavior needs parity coverage). Skips without `DATABASE_URL`.
- `test/e2e/postgres-bootstrap.test.ts` — exercises `PostgresEngine.initSchema()` directly against a real Postgres database: bootstrap → SCHEMA_SQL → migrations converge from a legacy brain shape, and a brain already at LATEST is an idempotent no-op. Live wedge-class convergence cases rewind a brain to an old schema shape and assert full `initSchema` convergence: pre-v121 timeline, pre-v143 `dream_verdicts` (including that pre-existing rows keep their `judged_at`-derived TTL instead of gaining a fresh 30 days), and pre-v7/pre-v136 `minion_jobs` shapes. Also covers the standalone `db.initSchema` replay path from `src/core/db.ts`, which shares the same bootstrap. Skips without `DATABASE_URL`.
- `test/e2e/http-transport.test.ts` — `gbrain serve --http` end-to-end against real Postgres: bearer auth round-trip, `last_used_at` SQL-level debounce, `mcp_request_log` row insertion on success and auth_failed paths, `/health` DB-down → 503 (DB-probing health check), and the dispatch round-trip with a real operation. Skips without `DATABASE_URL`.
- `test/e2e/serve-http-oauth.test.ts` — real-Postgres E2E against `gbrain serve --http` with full OAuth 2.1. Spawns a subprocess server, registers a client via the CLI, mints `client_credentials` tokens, exercises the `/mcp` JSON-RPC pipeline. Real DCR `/register` HTTP-level response-shape test (asserts `typeof body.client_id_issued_at === 'number'` over the wire, RFC 7591 §3.2.1); real CLI subprocess test for `revoke-client` (registers → mints token → revokes via `execSync` → asserts token rejected at `/mcp` → asserts re-run exits 1); server fixture flips on `--enable-dcr` so `/register` is reachable. **bun execSync env-inheritance contract:** bun's `execSync` does NOT inherit env mutations done via `process.env.X = ...`, only OS-level env from before bun started. helpers.ts loads `.env.testing` and sets `DATABASE_URL` via `process.env` mutation, which is invisible to subprocesses unless `env: { ...process.env }` is passed explicitly — every subprocess call in this file passes `env: { ...process.env }`. The same contract applies to the sibling sync/cycle/dream/claw-test E2Es. `afterAll` cleanup is guarded on `clientId` (won't throw if `beforeAll` failed before registration); cleanup errors surface to stderr without throwing so real test failures aren't masked. Also covers the trust boundary: an HTTP MCP `submit_job` for `name: "shell"` MUST reject with a permission error (request handler sets `remote: true` and `submit_job`'s protected-name guard fires), and the same guard rejects subagent submission. Skips without `DATABASE_URL`.
- `test/e2e/sync-parallel.test.ts` — `DATABASE_URL`-gated. 60-file Postgres sync at concurrency=4 imports all + no connection leak (probes `pg_stat_activity` before/after to confirm worker engines disconnected). 120-file serial-vs-parallel benchmark prints `SYNC_PARALLEL_BENCH N files | serial=Xms | parallel(4)=Yms | speedup=Zx`. Asserts parallel ≤ serial × 1.5 (CI-noise tolerant; not a strict speedup gate).
- `test/e2e/multi-source-bug-class.test.ts` — PGLite in-memory regression suite pinning every multi-source bug site: `listAllPageRefs` ordering by `(source_id, slug)`, `getPage` with sourceId picks the right `(source, slug)` row, `extract-takes` processes both overlapping `people/alice` rows independently, `listPages` filters correctly with `PageFilters.sourceId`, `addLinksBatch` with `from/to_source_id` targets the right rows, `validateSourceId` rejects path traversal, reverse-write disk layout uses `brainDir/.sources/<id>/<slug>.md` for non-default sources, `copyMigrationSources` lands source metadata before overlapping-slug pages. No `DATABASE_URL` needed. Wired into `scripts/e2e-test-map.ts` so changes to extract-takes / patterns / synthesize / embed / extract / migrate-engine auto-trigger it.
- `test/e2e/migrate-engine-sources-postgres.test.ts` — `DATABASE_URL`-gated companion for `gbrain migrate --to`: migrates a PGLite brain carrying two non-default sources with overlapping slugs into real Postgres and asserts `copyMigrationSources` created every `sources` FK parent (config JSONB intact, not double-encoded) before any page write. Unit-level manifest identity (crash manifest resumes only against the SAME target; legacy engine-only manifests start fresh) is `test/migrate-engine-resume.test.ts`.
- `test/e2e/facts-fence-reconcile-postgres.test.ts` — `DATABASE_URL`-gated round-trip for the escape-aware fence parser: renders a `## Facts` fence whose cells carry literal pipes, backslashes (Windows paths), and empty cells via `renderFactsTable`, runs the wipe-and-reinsert reconcile (`runExtractFacts`) on real Postgres, and asserts every cell survives byte-identically with no column shift.
- `test/e2e/source-isolation-pglite.test.ts` — PGLite in-memory regression suite pinning the source-isolation seal at two layers. Engine layer: `searchKeyword` / `searchVector` / `searchKeywordChunks` / `listPages` / `getPage` / `traverseGraph` / `traversePaths` apply `sourceId` (scalar fast path) and `sourceIds` (array path) correctly across both engines. Op-handler layer: routes through `sourceScopeOpts(ctx)` so a `read+write`-scoped OAuth client bound to `--source dept-x` cannot see rows from neighboring sources via `search`, `query`, `list_pages`, `get_page`, or `find_experts`. Covers both `ctx.sourceId` (single-source clients) and `ctx.auth.allowedSources` (federated_read clients) precedence; federated array wins over scalar wins over nothing. No `DATABASE_URL` needed.
- `test/e2e/think-source-isolation-pglite.test.ts` — PGLite in-memory suite pinning the `think` gather stage's source scope: seeds three sources with cross-source links and embedded takes, then asserts `runGather` under a federated `sourceIds` grant (and under a scalar `sourceId`) keeps every stream — hybrid retrieval, takes keyword + vector (`searchTakes`/`searchTakesVector`), and the `traversePaths` graph walk — inside the grant while still reaching authorized neighboring sources. No `DATABASE_URL` needed.
- `test/e2e/skill-brain-first.test.ts` — doctor reports `skill_brain_first` check with structured issues; `--fix --dry-run` previews insertion without writing; `--fix` applies the canonical Convention callout idempotently; `brain_first: exempt` frontmatter resolves the warn; `brain_first_typo` surfaces a paste-ready hint; audit JSONL records `detected` / `resolved` / `fixed` transitions; stable brain emits 0 audit lines/run.
- Journey suites (each claimed by an `scripts/e2e-test-map.ts` row; DATABASE_URL-gated unless noted): `migrate-engine-pglite-to-postgres.test.ts` (whole-brain `runMigrateEngine` transfer incl. the child-process failure arm — config not flipped), `takes-write-ops-postgres.test.ts` (takes op layer + `withPageLock` serialization), `propose-takes-jsonb-postgres.test.ts` + `calibration-profile-write.test.ts` (JSONB bind shape on real Postgres), `engine-parity-cjk.test.ts` (cross-engine CJK keyword parity on an identical corpus — both engines route `hasCJK()` queries through the shared ILIKE builder in `src/core/search/cjk-keyword-sql.ts`; top-slug agreement, chunk-grain parity, mixed-query AND semantics, nonexistent-term strictness), `code-edges-read-parity.test.ts` / `ontology-merge-parity.test.ts` / `chronicle-event-projection-parity.test.ts` / `health-parity-postgres.test.ts` (read-path + getHealth parity), `sync-sigkill-resume-postgres.test.ts` (real SIGKILL mid-sync; DB-polled checkpoint, stranded-lock reclaim, exactly-once resume), `serve-http-source-grant.test.ts` (legacy no-grant federated widening vs granted confinement over real `/mcp`), `mounts-routing-pglite.test.ts` (hermetic mount-routing tiers, no DATABASE_URL), `serve-http-surface-ceiling.test.ts` (hermetic 7-verb `--surface verbs` ceiling; the FORCE_SURFACE env is narrow-only), `autopilot-linux-lifecycle.serial.test.ts` + `upgrade-bun-link-arc.serial.test.ts` (PATH-shimmed crontab/systemctl and bun-link upgrade arcs, hermetic), and the thin-client daily-driver verb extension inside `thin-client.test.ts`.
- Tier 2 (`test/e2e/skills.test.ts`) requires OpenClaw + API keys, runs nightly in CI.
- `test/e2e/claw-test.test.ts` also covers live mode token-free via shim agents (`OPENCLAW_BIN=<sh script>`): the success-oracle break path (a do-nothing agent FAILS), the E0 child-friction merge surviving tempdir cleanup, and the upgrade staging + schema-version probe.
- If `.env.testing` doesn't exist in this directory, check sibling worktrees: `find ../ -maxdepth 2 -name .env.testing -print -quit` and copy it here if found.
- **Run E2E tests without asking permission.** When you want to verify behavior, there's a relevant E2E test, or you're shipping anything covered by an E2E suite — spin up the test DB, run the tests, tear down. Don't ask, don't propose it, don't defer. The lifecycle is short (~2-30s startup, sub-minute tests, instant teardown) and the gate value is high. Skipping with "DATABASE_URL unset" is silent regression, not caution.

### API keys and running ALL tests

ALWAYS source the user's shell profile before running tests:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc 2>/dev/null || true
```

This loads `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Without these, Tier 2 tests
skip silently. Do NOT skip Tier 2 tests just because they require API keys — load
the keys and run them.

When asked to "run all E2E tests" or "run tests", that means ALL tiers:
- Tier 1: `bun run test:e2e` (mechanical, sync, upgrade — no API keys needed)
- Tier 2: `test/e2e/skills.test.ts` (requires OpenAI + Anthropic + openclaw CLI)
- Always spin up the test DB, source zshrc, run everything, tear down.

### E2E test DB lifecycle (ALWAYS follow this)

The sequential E2E runner requires Python 3 for standard-library XML validation
of Bun's native JUnit reports. CI and the local Docker runner provide it; direct
host runs must have `python3` on `PATH` before launching tests.

`setupDB()` clears rows while preserving physical schema. Fixtures that seed
fixed legacy-width text vectors use `setupLegacyEmbeddingDB()` instead: it
establishes the canonical test shape after clearing the database, including
facts and takes, so a preceding CLI-init test cannot change their assumptions.
Custom-dimension and migration tests continue using ordinary `setupDB()`.
For fixtures testing schema/index creation or source-scoped cleanup, preserve
that lifecycle and derive incidental text-vector widths from the database.

You are responsible for spinning up and tearing down the test Postgres container.
Do not leave containers running after tests. Do not skip E2E tests, do not ask
permission to run them — see the "run without asking" rule above.

1. **Check for `.env.testing`** — if missing, copy from sibling worktree.
   Read it to get the DATABASE_URL (it has the port number).
2. **Check if the port is free:**
   `docker ps --filter "publish=PORT"` — if another container is on that port,
   pick a different port (try 5435, 5436, 5437) and start on that one instead.
3. **Start the test DB:**
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name gbrain-test-pg \
     -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
     -e POSTGRES_DB=gbrain_test \
     -p PORT:5432 pgvector/pgvector:pg16
   ```
   Wait for ready: `docker exec gbrain-test-pg pg_isready -U postgres`
4. **Bootstrap the schema** (required — fresh containers have no `oauth_clients`,
   `mcp_request_log`, `pages` etc.; tests like `serve-http-oauth.test.ts` will fail
   with `relation "oauth_clients" does not exist` if you skip this):
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:PORT/gbrain_test \
     bun run src/cli.ts doctor --json > /dev/null 2>&1
   ```
   `gbrain doctor` triggers `initSchema()` on first connect, which is the canonical
   way to bring a fresh DB to head. `apply-migrations --yes` alone does NOT seed
   the base schema — it runs ALTER-style migrations on top of `initSchema`. Tests
   that bypass the engine (raw `execSync`-spawned `auth register-client`) hit the
   schema directly and need this step to have run first.
5. **Run E2E tests:**
   `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:PORT/gbrain_test bun run test:e2e`
6. **Tear down immediately after tests finish (pass or fail):**
   `docker stop gbrain-test-pg && docker rm gbrain-test-pg`

Never leave `gbrain-test-pg` running. If you find a stale one from a previous run,
stop and remove it before starting a new one.

## Authorization regression gates

`test/data-frontmatter.test.ts` and `test/frontmatter-security.test.ts` pin inert
frontmatter parsing, opaque serialization, scalar compatibility, and import
errors. `test/authorization-boundaries.test.ts` covers scalar source grants,
foreign/private facts, and delegated tool exclusions.

`test/oauth-consent-security.test.ts` covers pending consent, CSRF, policy
changes, duplicate decisions, and uncertain completion. Production HTTP flows
live in `test/e2e/serve-http-consent.test.ts`; client-lock races and grant rollback
on Postgres live in `test/e2e/oauth-grant-transactions.test.ts`.

`test/minions-submission-authority.test.ts` covers submission schemas, durable
policy, lifecycle operations, legacy approval snapshots, file confinement, and
both workers. `test/e2e/minions-authority-parity.test.ts` exercises real Postgres
JSONB and authorization behavior. Filesystem write concurrency is pinned by the
existing fence and timeline suites.

`test/guarded-http.test.ts` and `test/guarded-http-tls.serial.test.ts` cover DNS,
TLS identity and ports, redirects, deadlines, body limits, and cleanup. CI runs
these boundaries on Bun 1.3.11 and 1.3.13, audits root and admin dependencies, and
executes `scripts/test-gitleaks-config.sh` to prove fixture exceptions still
report an unrelated secret in the same file. `scripts/scan-worktree-secrets.sh`
scans tracked files plus new files eligible for commit; tracked ignored files
remain included. Full-history scans use `gitleaks git . --log-opts=--all` from a
complete clone and reports must remain private.

The Docker gate sets `GBRAIN_CI_DISABLE_TEST_ENV_FILE=1` so a bind-mounted
developer `.env.testing` cannot add credentials or change the isolated test
database. Explicit local provider E2E runs can continue using that file.
