# CI guard: retired contributor-workflow phrases stay out of the docs agents follow.
#
# Refactor wave 1 moved the code several always-loaded instructions pointed at:
# migrations are one file each under src/core/schema-migrations/, migrated
# storage domains keep their SQL once in src/core/engine-sql/, CLI-only
# commands are records in src/cli/command-table.ts, the PGLite schema template
# is generated, and the migrate.ts region policy is gone. Agents follow
# CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/ and skills/ literally, so one
# stale sentence sends them to edit the wrong file. This guard fails when a
# retired phrase reappears there.
#
# Historical records are exempt: docs/designs/, docs/test-audit/,
# docs/incidents/, docs/plans/, docs/proposals/, docs/research/, docs/issues/,
# docs/superpowers/, docs/migrations/ and skills/migrations/ (release
# migration notes), and the wave 1 porting kit (docs/architecture/wave-1-*).
# CHANGELOG.md is outside the scanned set.
#
# Each failure prints FAIL / Why / Fix / See. To retire another phrase, add a
# row to RETIRED below (ERE pattern, TAB, the current instruction).
#
# Run: bash scripts/check-retired-phrases.sh
# Wired into `bun run verify` via package.json `check:retired-phrases`.
# Self-test seam: GBRAIN_GUARD_ROOT points at a fixture tree.

MIGRATIONS`? array	Migrations are one file each: `bun run new:migration <snake_name>` scaffolds src/core/schema-migrations/v<NNN>-<name>.ts and regenerates registry.generated.ts; migrate.ts is only the runner.

lands in BOTH	A migrated storage domain's SQL lives once in src/core/engine-sql/<domain>.ts and both engines delegate to it; only unmigrated or dialect-specific methods are written per engine (scripts/engine-sql-baseline.tsv).
Add the case to	A CLI-only command is a record in src/cli/command-table.ts plus its dispatch module src/cli/commands/<name>.ts, then `bun run build:flag-registry`.
region-exempt	The module-size ratchet has one policy (`ratchet`); migrate.ts is runner-only and ratcheted like every other file.
schema\.sql \+ pglite-schema\.ts|pglite-schema\.ts \+ schema\.sql	Schema DDL has one hand-edited copy: edit src/schema.sql (or the TS fragment its region banner names), then `bun run build:schema` regenerates schema-embedded.generated.ts and pglite-schema.generated.ts.
