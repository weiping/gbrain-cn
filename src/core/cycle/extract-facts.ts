/**
 * v0.32.2 — extract_facts cycle phase.
 *
 * Reconciles the facts DB index from the `## Facts` fence on each
 * entity page. Runs between the `extract` phase (which materializes
 * links + timeline) and `recompute_emotional_weight` so emotional
 * weight sees fresh take + fact state.
 *
 * Source-of-truth contract: the fence is canonical. For each page in
 * the affected slug set, this phase:
 *   1. Reads the markdown body (DB-side fetch via engine.getPage).
 *   2. Parses the `## Facts` fence with parseFactsFence.
 *   3. Maps ParsedFact → FenceExtractedFact via extractFactsFromFenceText.
 *   4. Collapses duplicate ACTIVE rows with the same (claim, source).
 *   5. Reconciles the page-scoped DB index by fence row number: matched
 *      (row_num, claim) rows are updated in place (ids stay stable), rows
 *      that left the fence are expired and detached (never deleted), and
 *      only new row numbers insert. No-op when already in sync (#1781).
 *
 * Warning-bearing parses are non-authoritative and preserve that page's
 * existing index. A page with no fence expires and detaches its fence-owned
 * rows; `cli:` conversation facts and soft-expired legacy rows are not
 * fence-owned and are left alone. Active fence-owned rows of soft-deleted
 * pages are expired at the start of each run.
 *
 * Empty-fence guard (Codex R2-#7; #2484; #2646): the phase refuses to do
 * its destructive reconciliation pass when genuinely-backfillable legacy
 * rows still exist — in THIS run's source only (`source_id = sourceId`;
 * a pending row in source A must not jam extraction for source B — the
 * source-isolation invariant) — `row_num IS NULL` (never fenced) AND
 * `entity_slug` resolves to a live page in this source (so the v0_32_2
 * migration's Phase B could fence them) AND the row is not soft-expired
 * (`expired_at IS NULL`). Status returns `warn` with a hint to re-run
 * the v0.32.2 fence backfill (`apply-migrations --force-retry 0.32.2`
 * then `--yes` — a bare `--yes` is a no-op once the ledger says
 * complete). Without the guard, an interrupted upgrade where v0_32_2
 * hasn't run could leave the cycle silently misreporting "0 facts on
 * people/alice" while legacy rows linger.
 *
 * The live-page requirement (#2484) is load-bearing: the inline facts
 * writer keeps producing `row_num IS NULL, entity_slug IS NOT NULL`
 * rows AFTER the migration completes, whenever a resolved slug has no
 * fenceable page (slugify-floor / stub-guard-blocked unprefixed slugs).
 * Those are structurally unfenceable — no page to fence onto, and the
 * ledger-complete migration won't re-run — so they must NOT gate, or
 * the phase jams forever (~16/day observed). Requiring a backing page
 * keeps genuine pre-v0.32.2 rows (whose entity page exists) gating
 * while excluding the inline-writer's permanent-unfenceable rows.
 *
 * Soft-expired rows don't count either (#2646): they're what
 * `forget_fact` produces, so excluding them lets operators drain the
 * backlog through the sanctioned removal path instead of raw SQL.

/**
 * #3625 (adversarial review, 2 rounds): whether `timeline` contains a
 * GENUINE Facts fence marker, as opposed to the marker text merely being
 * mentioned inside a fenced code example or quoted prose. A naive
 * `.includes(FACTS_FENCE_BEGIN)` false-positives on both — e.g. a page
 * whose real fence WAS removed, but whose timeline documents the fence
 * syntax in a ```markdown code block or a `> ...` blockquote, would wrongly
 * be treated as "misplaced" and block a genuine deletion, leaving stale
 * facts indexed indefinitely.
 *
 * Round 1 tried reusing fence-scan.ts's scanFencedBlocks() + string removal
 * of its extracted fence bodies. Round-2 adversarial review broke that:
 * scanFencedBlocks normalizes line endings (splits on `\r\n|\r|\n`, joins
 * fence bodies with plain `\n`) and strips opener indentation before
 * returning fence text — so `stripped.split(fenceText).join('')` on the
 * ORIGINAL (un-normalized) string silently fails to match a CRLF or
 * indented code block, leaving the marker inside it undetected and still
 * false-positive. Reconstructed-text removal can't safely undo a lossy
 * normalization.
 *
 * Fix: a self-contained single-pass line scanner (mirroring fence-scan.ts's
 * own CommonMark-subset opener/closer grammar, applied directly against
 * `timeline.split(/\r\n|\r|\n/)` — ONE split, no re-normalization, no
 * text-based removal) that skips lines between a real ``` /~~~ opener and
 * its closer, then checks whether any remaining line, trimmed, exactly
 * equals the marker. A real fence marker is always written as its own line
 * (see FENCE_BODY-shaped output from fence-write.ts / upsertFactRow), so
 * exact-line-match — on lines outside any code fence — rules out both
 * hazards without needing a full markdown AST (mirrors
 * findTimelineSplitIndex's own `trimmed === sentinel` pattern for the same
 * class of problem on the timeline sentinel itself). An unclosed opener
 * runs to EOF (matches fence-scan.ts's documented behavior) — a marker
 * appearing after it is inside an ambiguous, unclosed block and is not
