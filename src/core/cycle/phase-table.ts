/**
 * Managed-brain phase table (fix wave 3, CEO managed-brain phase matrix /
 * Eng E-D15). Every phase in `ALL_PHASES` is classified by what it does on a
 * managed brain (persistence enabled):
 *
 * - `writes`: publishes canonical rows or files through the coordinator.
 * - `no_coordinated_write`: writes nothing coordinated by design (derived
 *   projections, side tables, reports outside the brain), with the reason.
 * - `managed_skip`: deliberately skipped on managed brains, with the reason
 *   the cycle report shows.
 *
 * `test/managed-phase-matrix.test.ts` fails for a phase missing here and runs
 * each classified phase once on a managed PGLite and Postgres brain.
