/**
 * Health / occupancy probes for `gbrain mcp expose`, peeled from
 * `mcp-expose.ts`: one bounded `tryFetch` that never throws, the `/health`
 * bar (`probeHealth`), the "does ANYTHING listen" bar (`probeOccupied`), the
 * wall-clock poller (`pollHealth`) and the name-resolution verdict behind the
 * `verify.tailnet` warn.
 *
 * Why a resolver call and not just the fetch error: Bun's `fetch` rejects an
 * unresolvable host with the SAME error as a refused connection
 * (`Unable to connect. Is the computer able to access the url?`, code
 * `ConnectionRefused`), so a message match alone never fires in production.
 * After a rejection the URL's hostname is handed to `deps.lookup` (default
 * `dns.promises.lookup`) and ITS error decides; the message regex stays a
 * secondary hint for runtimes that do spell the cause out. IP literals and
 * `localhost` never involve the resolver and are skipped.
 *
 * Every side effect is injected through `ProbeDeps` (a narrow slice of
 * `mcp-expose.ts`'s resolved deps) so tests run with a fake fetch, a fake
 * TCP probe and a fake resolver.
