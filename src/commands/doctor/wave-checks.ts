/**
 * Wave checks: the doctor checks that report residual state from the managed
 * persistence waves, each with a stable id and a declared resolution. One
 * table feeds four consumers so they can never disagree:
 *
 *   - the local doctor (checks registered here rather than inline in doctor.ts),
 *   - the remote doctor's sanitized host-action lines (report-remote.ts),
 *   - `gbrain doctor --remediate` finding classification,
 *   - the `gbrain post-upgrade` banner.
 *
 * `resolution` says how a non-ok finding clears: `repair` (a registered
 * `gbrain repair` kind names this check in its `checks`), `operator` (a named
 * manual action on the brain host), or `unsupported` (no command can clear it
 * yet; it is reported, never hidden). Add a check by appending one entry.
