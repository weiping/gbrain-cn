   * Why source-id keyed by default (v0.40.3.0):
   *   PR #1314 originally only changed the lock id inside the parallel

   * path keeps bare `tryAcquireDbLock` for back-compat (no caller
   * depends on the global lock surviving past 30 minutes today).
   *
   * Total live Postgres connections per parallel `sync --all` wave:
   *   parallel  ×  workers  ×  2 (per-file pool inside each worker)
   *   + parent pool. See DEFAULT_PARALLEL_SOURCES in sync-concurrency.ts.
